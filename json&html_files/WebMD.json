      "review": "WebMD has literally saved my life a few times by giving me the information on medications that were prescribed for me; not too long ago, I was given a medication for PTSD and was not told that it is also used for high blood pressure. I had taken my night time medications which included my Diovan for high blood pressure, as well as the medication Prozocin which was prescribed for PTSD and was never told by any of my physicians that this was originally prescribed for high blood pressure. I went to my doctor for a treatment and I was so lethargic that the on call doctor thought I had overdosed because my blood pressure was so low 48/20 and he told the nurse to give me Narcan which made me very very sick. They were told that I hadn’t taken anything besides my blood pressure pill and the 3 Prozocin for my PTSD. And they never mentioned that I had literally taken too much medication to combat high blood pressure between the two medications. I came home from the hospital and went to WebMD and found answers about all of my medications and I had three other medications that were not supposed to be used together and made an appointment to discuss this with my physician and my medications were changed. After this close call I always use WebMd to check out any mew prescription that I am given before I ever get it filled. Thank you WEBMD FOR SAVING MY LIFE! Rhonda Moffatt more"

      "review": "PLEASE change your method of recommending other articles. Especially for people who are just skimming headlines, if an article pops up that says something like masks no longer required, but now masks are required again, you create a vicious cycle of misinformation. Please prominently feature the date of the article with the headline whenever displaying the headline. Perhaps for COVID related articles and other quickly changing topics you could remove them from the recommended pool after a week or some appropriate length of time, but still make them available for search results, with the article date prominently displayed? more"

      "review": "Thanks to a recent update, this app is much more accessible for those of us who use VoiceOver. Now that I can use it, I find it terrific!!As an update to this review done months later, I find one issue. If I do a search in Conditions, I have to completely close and reopen the app, as no Back button appears. Otherwise, it is terrific! Yet another update to my initial review. I still have to close the app to get out of a major category, such as Conditions or Search. Now, in addition, if I am in Conditions, the A-Z list will not come up at all, even though it says it’s displaying. This means I can only access the Popular Searches. I’m out of luck if I need to look up something rare. I hope these will be fixed soon. Further update: Despite more updates to the app, all of the annoying bugs already mentioned are still there. I still have to close the app in order to go to another section (e.g., from Conditions to Drugs). I still can’t bring up the A-Z list of Conditions, or the A-Z list of Drugs; it’s only the Most Popular for both. No scrolling to a rare condition, or to a drug that isn’t on the top 94. May not be deliberate discrimination, but is frustrating nonetheless. Please fix! more"
