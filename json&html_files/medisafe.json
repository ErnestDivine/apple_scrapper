      "review": "This app!!! So simple to use and yet so powerful! I have struggled for years to keep up with my med schedule on my own (manually). When a friend suggested this app, I thought, ‚ÄúWhy have I never considered trying to manage them through technology?!‚Äù And I am so amazed! Just Wow! It‚Äôs changed my life so much!! I literally have to take medicine every two hours, so getting an alert instead of having to watch the clock is such a game changer for me! Also, no more guessing whether I took a medicine or not ‚Ä¶ and what time I actually took it (which is important for timing out my meds because I can‚Äôt take certain meds too close together). I can look back and say, ‚Äúoh yeah, I was late taking this med by 30 minutes, so let me reschedule this next med for 30 minutes later. Oh, and that throws off the schedule for these others, so let me ‚Äúeasily‚Äù reschedule those as well.‚Äù Entering all my meds into the app was so easy and being able to enter the Rx number, amount of pills left, and set notifications for when to refill ‚Ä¶ guys, I just can‚Äôt say enough. It‚Äôs one of the simplest apps on my phone, but one that has had the greatest impact on my life. Thank you (to the developers) for making such a great, well thought out, powerful but simple to use app. It‚Äôs simplicity to use is what makes it so great. Making it complicated would have detracted from its power as the time-saving, life-saving tool you‚Äôve developed. more"

      "review": "I have been using this app for years. Even though version 8 made some weird bugs appear it was never as bad as this latest update. I can‚Äôt open the app. I can't do anything as tapping on its icon makes it load and then after less than 3 seconds it instantly closes and the same thing happens if I reopen it. I tried to open it five times and the same thing happens. A phone restart did not fix this and I am now worried this update that the App Store says was released Sunday means I can‚Äôt keep track of meds **easily** as I have been doing for years until (if?) this weird bug gets fixed. I stuck with this app for years as it was the only way to make sure I 100% took my meds with my severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Before using it I skipped meds rather than accidentally take a double dose (I forget and obsess about taking a medicine or not a looot‚Ä¶.) so I am hoping this gets fixed within a week. I am editing the review to note that I never created an account for this app because of privacy worries so I can‚Äôt delete it and re-download it to see if that fixes it :( ***second edit added after the August 25th update follows***: it works! It works again!!!! Thank you, Medisafe team ü•≥üòÅ more Hey there, we really appreciate you coming back and updating your review. We're glad to be assisting you in your health and wellness path. more"

      "review": "I don‚Äôt usually take prescription medication but have had to recently due to medical complications from an emergency hospital visit. When I do I usually research the med and it‚Äôs side effects. Even in my research I don‚Äôt always come across every interaction it has with other foods or meds. Seems like more meds keep getting added to my care every other day. My doctor called me this afternoon with a new med based on some lab work. No mention to interactions with my current meds. My husband picks up the meds from the pharmacy, no mention by the pharmacist of any interactions. Load the new med into the app and check for interactions and critical alert and red is what I see. Immediately call the pharmacist and not only could I not take the med at the time I was planning, I can‚Äôt take it with 2 of my other critical meds. If it wasn‚Äôt for this app I don‚Äôt know if I would have found this interaction on my own but my doctors and pharmacist most certainly should have. With my vitals and current condition there was a high chance that I would have stopped breathing in the middle of the night. Thank you seriously! This app is amazing and I will keep using for every family member and love I can use it when I go down to just my supplements. more"
