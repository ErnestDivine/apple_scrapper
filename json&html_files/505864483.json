      "review": "I love this app!! It's so helpful and free!! Every week there is an update on what's developing and going on with your baby and their body, what is going on with your body, tips & health advice, several articles and videos you can unlock either buying premium or through watching enough ads to unlock them about pregnancy workouts (midwife advice, classes, etc), pregnancy tools (i.e. size comparison of your baby, bumps pics storage for each month, a place to keep track of appointments, etc) as well as some pregnancy tools you have to unlock through premium via the previously mentioned ways such as: a birth plan, kick counter, contraction counter, hospital bag (each thing coming with a list of suggested items you might not have thought of). LITERALLY THE BEST FREAKING APP for your pregnancy journey, it has been a god sent for me!! more Hi there! Thank you for your kind words and for the 5-star review. We are delighted to hear that you like our app so much. We are working hard to make the best pregnancy App and it's lovely to see that you have enjoyed the Pregnancy+ experience. Wishing you all the best in your pregnancy and parenting journey. more"

      "review": "So I originally got this app with my 1st pregnancy, but I didn‚Äôt pay for the premium because at the time I thought it was bonkers to pay $4.99 for a pregnancy app when all the other pregnancy apps are free. I decided to purchase the app with my current pregnancy back when so found out I was pregnant in August 2020. I KNOW I paid for the app because I would not have been able to use a majority of the features however.... when I decided that I wanted to make a birth plan and use the app to do it, it says I have to purchase the premium for $1.99 which I couldn‚Äôt understand because I paid $4.99 for premium. Every once in a while I‚Äôll have apps that do this so I‚Äôll just tap ‚Äúrestore‚Äù and it restores my purchase and everything is fine. NOT WITH THIS APP. I tapped ‚Äúrestore‚Äù and a message pops up that says ‚ÄúAlert: You have not purchased the app.‚Äù YES I HAVE PURCHASED THE APP. This leads me to think that even though you have to pay $4.99 for the premium, there is also an additional $1.99 charge for the premium that they have snuck in making this app actually $6.98. Phillips what are you doing???? more Sorry to hear you are having problems with restoring your purchase. Please select the Feedback button in the More section of the App to reach our customer service team. They can help you get this sorted! We appreciate your patience. more"
