      "review": "As someone who has suffered from migraines for my entire life I was always trying to find an effective way to track them and record details. However, I kept having trouble remembering and keeping everything organized. I love this app because itâ€™s so easy to enter the info, but it also has a good amount of detail. It compiles the data and presents it to you in an interesting way that can help you get a new perspective on symptoms, triggers, and your bodyâ€™s patterns. I especially like the sleep tracking part (itâ€™s linked to my FitBit, but it can also link to an Apple Watch), as that is one of my main triggers, and having definitive information about my sleep schedule can really help me predict and prevent migraines. The resources are helpful and the chat forum is a wonderful place to discuss your experiences with other migraine sufferers, as well as to get advice or tips on how to manage your migraines. My main issues with the app are mostly that there are occasionally typos, which can sometimes make it feel slightly less professional, and that the layout could probably be improved a little (itâ€™s quite bland and sometimes things kinda blur together). If I were to suggest anything I would suggest the ability to make a more in-depth profile and the option to do private messaging. I believe it would be quite helpful to be able to have one-on-one conversations with people you might have met through the forum. more Thank you for your strong support! You can send your buddy link to other users and start a one to one chat with them. Just post in a group chat your buddy link adding @user name you want to have a private conversation with.

      "review": "As someone whoâ€™s struggled with chronic debilitating migraines for over 15 years and tried so so many different things without any success... Iâ€™d also tried many different tracking methods and finally decided that tracking wasnâ€™t going to help, but hinder, as it caused too much focus on the migraines and I needed to focus on living. But this app has changed all of that!!! THANK YOU Migraine Buddy for creating something that helps me do both! For helping me easily, quickly and simply input data about my migraines, keep track, and keep living my life to the best of my ability. But ALSO, the oh so helpful tools, connection with the community, reports, weather (my biggest trigger has always been barometric pressure!! - and now for the first time EVER I have the ability to plan to the hour of when I can take my meds or know when Iâ€™m going to start going downhill just to know even if I canâ€™t take one of my meds... itâ€™s helps to know if I need to buck up or to go lay down if I can), ability to see patterns, etc... this app and its tools has been the single most helpful thing in the last decade for me of communicating with my doctors, identifying my auras, and figuring out what actually helps. Thank you!! All in a way that doesnâ€™t take over my life and keep me fixated on my migraines - they are already present enough! If you have migraines and are thinking about this app - GET IT! more Thank you so much for such a great review! Jenny more"

      "review": "Iâ€™ve had migraines the majority of my life but they increased in severity and frequency in the last five years to the point I went searching for more answers and treatments than OTCs could offer. A doctor told me I should be tracking them to better understand my triggers and my research led me to this app. I love the interface. Itâ€™s calming to look at when I do have a migraine. It feels like a friend who understands my pain, my triggers, and what helps. Being able to track them and see patterns is very useful. I do subscribe to the plus version but itâ€™s totally worth it to me even though I feel itâ€™s a bit pricey. Iâ€™ve been subscribed long enough Iâ€™ve seen them add updates and use user feedback to improve what the app offers so I feel like the developers listen and respond to us. I like the discussions with other users. I love that Iâ€™m helping contribute to research for migraines. The guides to understanding migraines were helpful because I didnâ€™t know a lot and I learned so much through the app. The app helped me figure out what my triggers even are, and a few were surprising, and other users helped me figure out some options for relief. Great app overall. With a lot of great features even if you donâ€™t subscribe for all of them. more Thank you so much for the compliment. Feedback from people like you are critical to how we improve and continue making Migraine Buddy the best Migraine app for patients by patients. ðŸ’–Jenny more"
