      "review": "I woke up the other day and felt horrible, I didnâ€™t know what to do so I asked my mom to bring me to quick care or something, thinking it was nothing, my mom decided to just wait until she finished making lunch for my dad. In the meantime, the whole thing got even worse within seconds so I searched up my symptoms in order to see what I had or what I can do. Then I stumbled upon this app, i put all my symptoms and problems, and they told me to go to the er. I told my mom and she immediately took me down there. Turns out, I had a disease that was almost deadly if left untreated. Iâ€™m super thankful that I saw this app! more"

      "review": "I was putting all my symptoms to check this out and I have done certain area and with all the symptoms it says multiple sclerosis which I have been diagnosed. I have been concerned with the rheumatoid arthritis and it says that itâ€™s high or whatever. Then I focused on my stomach and I have been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome which is what this said it could be. Now going to add in my back pain and see if it matches up with what this colonoscopy tells me. This app is pretty cool!! more"

      "review": "This app, like most doctors, simply donâ€™t understand that people get more than one health problem at the same time. This hyper-advanced concept is simply rejected these days because it forces doctors (and apps) to actually thinkâ€¦ instead of being told what to think. They get so confused. If you are diabetic with sleep apnea, this app gets just as confused as any doctor. But this app is easy and fantastic if you just have one problem. Nice interface and easy to use. I give it five stars for basic issues. more"
