      "review": "Wow. This was he first time I‚Äôve used plush care and it was a really good experience. Dr. Savery was right on time, professional friendly. She was kind and warm in our interaction and it really was just like a doctors visit in an office but I never had to get out of bed. I‚Äôm feeling terrible and the thought of having to get up, dressed drive and commit probably 2 or more hours out Was too daunting. She spent all the time needed with no rush. I called because I felt like I had a uti, which came on very quick. I‚Äôve experienced this multiple times a year the last few years and I was discouraged to have to go through all the motions of physically seeing a doctor when I suspected I needed antibiotics, it‚Äôs been a 5 minute discussion in the past, prescription and done. So, she diagnosed me just the same as physically having to see a doctor. She gave me the precautions to look for if I were to get worse and needed a face to face visit. She called in my prescription, so, I can just make a quick trip to pick it up and I‚Äôll be better. My insurance no longer covers my doctor I‚Äôve seen for years and I don‚Äôt want to switch so, when I rarely need a doctor, I pay out of pocket anyway. So, it was only about $15 more than an in office visit. This service is amazing and I‚Äôm so glad I decided to try it. I‚Äôm so thankful for seeing dr. Savery today. more"

      "review": "I have used this twice, now. I was worried about having multiple doctors but the Doctors are awesome, compassionate, ask the right questions, in a short period of time, and never rushed. PlushCare keeps a log of your visits. Which is headache free to remember them all. I get frequent utis. Having to sit for hrs in an emergency room in pain. I no longer have to wait. Make an appt, be prepared to answer questions. Docs are earlier than appt and so far the Docs are better than an emergency visit. When you know you need antibiotics. The docs do send you to get a culture tests done. Pick a location close to you. So easy to get done, quickly. Lab techs are just as fantastic! I have had my culture lab test lost at an emergency room twice and your sitting not knowing for more hrs. They lost it. (Mind you. Your paying for it.)üòû I felt nervous seeing multiple Doctors but so far. üíØ stress free. Most of all affordable and do use your ins, too. If you have it. PlushCare is a Godsend. This is just a perfect way to see a doctor for minor medical issues without leaving your home. Easy to set up. Easy to change your pu location for meds, etc... So easy to use, bottom line. Thank you Dr Crabtree and Dr Riad üòä Also I will mention the communication thru, video chat, emails and texts, is easy and not confusing at all. üëçüëçüëç more"

      "review": "I found PlushCare while seeking answers to support both myself and my daughter who tested positive for the Omicron virus. Although I was fully vaccinated I developed a fever and a cold that progressed into the worst sore throat I have ever experienced in my life. I started getting really nervous as my throat was severely inflamed and I believe I developed throat ulcers. I had terrible coughing fits that burned terribly and I was concerned about my breathing going forward as I was struggling with swallowing. The constant nasal drip made things more difficult. This went on for two full days. Finally I was able to book a 7am appt with Dr Chansky after being up at 2pm, again. She knew right away what I was experiencing and prescribed Miracle Mouthwash and an anti inflammatory that my partner picked up just three hours later. Later, after approximately 25 hours of excruciating pain, my throat like opened up and almost all of my throat pain dissipated-I could swallow normally again! The Magic Mouthwash helped me sleep and eat in the interim. Ps-I eventually discovered that green tea w coconut oil and greasy lo mein noodles was a saving grace to put down food and medicine and stay hydrated. Thank you Dr. Chansky and thank you Plushcare!!! You saved me and kept me out of the very swamped hospital. more"
