Using a familiar Maps-like interface, you can measure the size of a mole using the camera and a reference coin. Keeping track of the size, shape and color of your moles is one of the best ways to catch potential skin cancers like melanoma in their early stages. Whether you use MoleMapper™ to keep track of a single suspicious mole over time or construct a full-body map, we hope this app will make being vigilant about your health a bit more enjoyable. Happy Mapping! more",
