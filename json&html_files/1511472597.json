      "review": "The only reason I‚Äôm giving this app two stars is because it told me what the condition was actually named which I knew I had previously confirmed from my doctor. However, it pretty much says every result is concerning or has a high cancer risk. For example I have benign seborrheic keratosis on my arm that I‚Äôve had since I was a teenager and it said my cancer risk was 85% and I needed to run to a dermatologist. Even a quick google search will tell you seborrheic keratosis are not pre-cancerous. Yet, they say it is a huge cancer risk. They also diagnosed me with lentigo on my arm saying it was most likely (74%) precancerous when Lentigo is, by the books, harmless but can resemble dangerous lesions. Then they try to get you to pay for a ‚Äúdermatologist‚Äù of theirs opinion. Just go to the doctor or monitor your own skin and go with your instinct. This will only make anxiety flair. more We are sorry that you did not like our application. We would like to note that our App can't substitute a doctor, the app helping you to monitor your skin health and detect any unusual or alerting skin conditions. AI Dermatologist screening recognizes 58 different skin conditions and tells you when to book an appointment. App is created on the basis of artificial intelligence as a result of joint work of IT specialists and doctors. Again we would like to remind everyone (and this has been emphasized honestly throughout the process) that we are not a replacement for physician consultation and we cannot diagnosis. And we will constantly improve to make the application more and more perfect. more"

      "review": "Just to preface, a large majority of these 5 star reviews aren't real people. This app is a great example of why AI is not yet capable of adequately replacing people. Out of curiosity, I downloaded it to snap a picture of a small circular cut on my arm. To my surprise, the app tells me there's a 90% chance I have squamous cell carcinoma and that I need to see a dermatologist immediately. My cut has since healed and was nothing more than a small bump. I can understand the principle of overestimating these things, but the fact that this app charges you for what is more likely than not to be a misdiagnosis is disgusting. If you're really concerned about a spot on your skin, don't bother with this and just go straight to your physician. more Thank you for sharing your experience. We want to clarify that our app does not provide diagnoses or recommendations, but rather assists users in monitoring their skin health. We're sorry to hear that you're dissatisfied with our app, and we understand your concerns. However, we assure you that all our reviews are from real users, and our goal is to help individuals keep track of their skin health. We appreciate your feedback and will continue to work on improving our services. more"
