      "title": "Great cooling sensation",
      "review": "When I first tried this product I thought that the cooling moisturizer was a good topper for skincare. Although my acne did reduce, I think I‚Äôd prefer products I can use on the daily, your $9 trial is a really good way for people to test your products and see if they‚Äôd want to continue using it on the long-term. Needless to say, the acne treatment cream is great and is good for me to use. Sometimes the products are a little tingly though which is fine, however I am on a time cramp in the morning and I like using daily products for sensitive skin, I have products that are not done yet so I will have to use those before trying more MDacne products. You are a great brand with good researchers. It is a little pricy for me to pay the $24 a month thing, but if you‚Äôre an adult working and have acne products I think it‚Äôs safe to try MDacne continuously and reduce products from different brands as to lower your sensitivity, they say continuity is key and that‚Äôs true for skincare, since this brand focuses on acne I hope more people become more confident with your products(acne can make people lose esteem but it‚Äôs okay, acne is natural and there‚Äôs always a remedy, don‚Äôt feel like hope is lost I just know that if your face isn‚Äôt super sensitive to customized skincare than that means you can overcome acne within a month to one year) more"

      "review": "I‚Äôve been using McAcne for 10 months now. Though at one point my skin started drying up real bad as we were bout to hit winter season. I messaged Dr. Harth about my concerns in hopes he could help me with it. He responded quickly and gave me some advice and a night cream to use every other night aside from my daily routine. If I‚Äôm being honest, I stopped using my day cream. I use my day/night wash and my night cream (before bed). I wake up, wash my face with cool water and use a moisturizer by neutrogena (clear face SPF30) break-out free liquid lotion sunscreen through out the day. Also great before foundation (if ever you decide to wear makeup). I‚Äôm not saying to stop using your day cream. Everyone‚Äôs skin is not the same, just like their skin care products. Whatever works for you, great! Don‚Äôt hesitate to message the Doctors if you can‚Äôt seem to find the right routine for you! Thank you McAcne! I‚Äôve never felt so confident about my facial skin since middle school! I appreciate all the help I‚Äôve received and I‚Äôm definitely gonna continue using your products! THANK YOU! üòÅ‚úäüèº more This is music to our ears! Great suggestion to other folks to use the dermatologist chat support during treatment! This enables us to tweak your routine or products as needed to ensure you get the best results. So excited for you and your renewed confidence! more"

      "review": "Though I‚Äôve been using this skin care treatment since the start of summer I‚Äôve learned it takes time. Right in the beginning of using their products my skin started to get dry and worse but as time went on there has been a lot of improvement. Throughout 7 months I‚Äôve been using it I‚Äôve had times when my skin was at its best but then right after I thought everything was getting better. I got more and more breakouts. I‚Äôve seen a big improvement in my skin from when I first started. Everyone‚Äôs skin is different but the process takes time and it‚Äôs definitely worth it. I still do have acne now and acne scars but it‚Äôs way better than before. The staff are great and help me with all my questions I have about my skin or about other products on the app. Although I‚Äôm still unhappy with how my face looks I still gotta wait until it gets better. The products really do help and work but IT TAKES TIME. So don‚Äôt be all mad when your skin doesn‚Äôt clear up in the first month because it‚Äôs not how it‚Äôs works. This product has helped me a lot and can‚Äôt wait until my skin is all cleared!! more"
