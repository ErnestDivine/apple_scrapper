      "review": "Only sad that I didn‚Äôt create it myself instead of waiting for it to come out. Lol Great app, just not sure if it‚Äôs cost effective $6.99 a week is a tad steep. I feel like if subscriptions were more affordable we wouldn‚Äôt be reluctant to have a few going but this unfortunately doesn‚Äôt take priority over the larger needed ones.
