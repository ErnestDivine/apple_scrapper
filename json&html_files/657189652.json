      "review": "I honestly can‚Äôt thank the creators of this app enough. I‚Äôve been using this app for years and Clue has continued to update their app to improve function and usefulness for the masses. It not only tracks your period, but just about anything else health-related, too! It follows your moods, cravings, energy levels, exercise levels, weight, acne, you name it. If you mess up with following your period, you can even go to your analysis section and choose to omit a specific cycle from your overall period tracking; for example, I forgot to track my periods for a few months. When I came back, I simply hid that cycle from in history so it wouldn‚Äôt skew my future period predictions. Even from an educational standpoint, the app offers plentiful resources to gain access to information about contraception, love and sexuality, fertility, and even postpartum symptoms. You can use this app to do, literally, WHATEVER you need‚Äîit all depends on how much information you pour into it. The more data you enter, the more accurate and helpful the app will be for you. It also helps you be more attentive to what you‚Äôre feeling and how every internal and external factor is influencing all the different aspects of your personal health. I love how expansive and all-encompassing Clue is, and it has become a staple in my own health/self care journey. Thank you, Clue! more Hi, we really appreciate you taking the time to write such a positive and thoughtful review. Thank you for sharing what you find useful, it's really helpful to hear what does work for users of the app. I have shared this with the rest of the team, it will make their day! We‚Äôre really excited about what‚Äôs coming up in the future for Clue and we can't wait to bring more features and functionality to our users. Thank you again, Rhiannon from Clue. more"

      "review": "This app is literally the best period tracker I‚Äôve ever had. I started using it just over a year ago(ish), and it‚Äôs truly been helpful. I added in my past periods from another app and that helped a lot with it being able to always be spot on for my days. One thing I would recommend, is having a ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù section for days. I feel like that would be nice because I can remember why I didn‚Äôt take my BC (birth control) at a certain time and I can work on being more on time with it. It‚Äôd also be nice to keep track of other things in there, such as ‚Äúmy cramps were this bad today because xyz.‚Äù And instead of using just the cramps button, I can make a note of how bad or mild they were on which days so I can expect it for next time. I also feel as if it would be easier when talking to an OB/GYN about my periods because my cramps can sometimes be too horrible to the point I can‚Äôt even get up and out of bed (the top reason why I‚Äôm even taking it - and how irregular my cycle was before). A couple months ago I got the subscription to Clue, and it‚Äôs even better than I imagined! I enjoy getting the articles for what I feel on my period; certain emotions, why my cramps can be killer, etc. I‚Äôd definitely recommend this app to all my fellow friends. üíï more"

      "review": "I like this app. I just started using it maybe 7 months ago, and even though I only had three pretty irregular periods, I was pleasantly surprised at how accurate the ovulation and period predictions were. It only took the first cycle for the next predictions to be shockingly accurate. It was very nice to have a discrete little banner warning me that my period was supposed to start soon. I love all the symptoms we can track, and the cycle analysis over time. Overall I would like to say I love the app. But I can't. Because I'm now pregnant, and there's no way for me to change my life stage to \"pregnancy\" from \"menstruating\" without signing up for Clue Plus. I understand and accept that Clue wants us to pay for the pregnancy information, but I don't understand why I can't even change my status (and effectively put my cycle on \"pause\") until I give birth. I feel disappointed that this excessively long \"cycle\" could skew the information they collected from the previous ones, making my predictions less accurate for a long time postpartum. I can't imagine how much more disappointing this would be if I had been using this app for longer. I also think it would help to add a \"postpartum\" or \"breastfeeding\" life stage, since you aren't pregnant anymore but those situations still effect if/when you menstruate. more Hello, thanks for leaving us this review. Our pregnancy tracking mode is a paid feature, but we do offer a 7-day free trial where you can test it out and see if you find the content and tracking useful (it comes with tons of guided content, painstakingly written and fact-checked by our science team, as well as a whole suite of pregnancy-specific tracking features). We also have a post-partum life stage you can choose. If you prefer not to join Clue Plus, you can also exclude a cycle in the analysis tab so your data isn‚Äôt skewed. Hope this helps! Feel free to write us from the app or from support.helloclue.com if you have questions. Ilaria more"
