      "review": "I have tried a few symptom tracking apps and this is my favorite. The others I didn‚Äôt use for long before giving up due to interface issues and/or the program not tracking the information in a way that was useful to me. Th is app allows you to open up the day and quickly record various symptoms and severity level. You can also customize your personal symptom menu by adding /removing symptoms. You can even create your own symptoms if the app doesn‚Äôt already have it. I purchased the full version and IMO it has been well worth it. Once you pay, that‚Äôs it there are no additional hidden fees like some apps. There is also a physician report that allows you to create a pdf file of your symptoms- you specify the date range to include. It‚Äôs been extremely helpful to tracck my symptoms and daily journal entries so when I meet with my doctor I have a solid and detailed record of history to share. more Oh thank you so much for sharing the kind words! I truly appreciate it ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôèüèº more"

      "review": "Don‚Äôt bother looking elsewhere unless told by your doc. This app allows you to log and even create new pain and mood types, rate those by severity, and keep notes. No cutesy crap, no cartoon animals just a solid tool that you can customize and track mood and pain issues. You could likely use this to track other things. It even pulls data from Health. The only thing that could make it better is if it had a feature to add meds taken that also logs them to Apple Health, or at least pull in meds from Apple Health for the day you log symptoms. Either way, you guys saved me from writing my own app! Although, I‚Äôm still considering doing one in Gtk on Linux. Thanks for this! more"

      "review": "This app does track symptoms but if you are tracking a lot a symptoms it is pretty much useless. There are no analytics at all aside from the ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù report. That report only offers a color coded intensity - does not even include the average number for a more precise information. Also does not provide the most basic of analytics or insights like ‚Äúon days you woke up without an alarm these symptoms were less‚Äù. You can compare symptom by symptom but only two at a time and only one day. Factors is also useless as it does not interact with the symptoms data at all, it might as well be part of the journal. When I messaged to ask about this they stated we don‚Äôt get into analyzing because it could be diagnosis. If you don‚Äôt offer diagnosis (an actual condition) and slap on the same warning like every other health app does then you aren‚Äôt diagnosing anything. It seems like an easy way to not do the work of actually processing the data in a meaningful way. This was a huge disappointment and I regret paying for this app and would like my money back. more"
