      "review": "I‚Äôm a busy mom, lots of little ones and too much on my plate. I‚Äôve put off getting my thyroid levels checked for way too long and Im very thankful my medical provider due to a construction issue with their normal on-site lab facilities recommended using the at-home test kit instead of going to a traditional lab location across town. I‚Äôll never have an excuse to delay getting testing done! Kit was so well put together and simple! It came complete with all needed supplies and thanks to the super easy to use video-instructions,with their helpful App even my nine year old was able to walk me through the steps and she loved being able to help! The coolest part was the ‚Äúcheck my sample‚Äù step which used a photo to check that my sample was done correctly which eliminated all stress. I was very thankful for that step to make sure that it‚Äôs done correctly. Coolest test ever! Thank you Everlywell- I will definitely be utilizing more of your other test kits and will be telling friends and family to find your kits too! Thank you for making the obstacle of lab testing super accessible, affordable (same price as a traditional lab copay for me) and such a streamlined process! Loved it! more Thank you so much for the lovely review! üíö Would you be open to sharing more about your story? If so, please email us at stories@everlywell.com. We'd love to hear from you! more"

      "review": "This app functions well, but too bad it is for a worthless product. It does not provide numbers, just a positive (or negative) response. The ‚Äúsupport‚Äù they offer is a call center rep telling you that the results are positive and go to the doctor. I didn‚Äôt ask for a definitive diagnosis, but selling this as offering support is deceptive marketing, if not outright lying. You can talk to a ‚Äúprovider‚Äù but it is just a mid-level who cannot diagnose. I can read ‚Äúpositive‚Äù and ‚Äútalk to a doctor‚Äù without a call center rep or paying a midlevel to read it to me. What is the point of a test not providing numbers and ranges?! Are they just randomly throwing out positives and negatives in results?! Further, my doctor (actual DO who uses a reputable lab) repeated the testing and my results were NOT positive, not even close to positive. In fact, not only was I NOT positive on the one thing they said I was, I WAS positive on the thing they said I was not! Total joke and waste of money. Very deceptive marketing. Other reputable labs will do many of these same tests for cash pay and actually provide numbers and resources to understand numbers. What a joke. more Hi! We take this feedback seriously, and would love to dig into this further. Please reach out to our team directly at contact@everlywell.com. Thanks! more"
