      "review": "I never gave a crap about my diabetes until I lost both of my parents at the age of 51. They both were diabetic and although that wasn‚Äôt necessarily the cause of their death as my dad had cancer and my mom had an upper GI bleed along with other issues it certainly did not help. My A1C was out of control at 10.2! Here I was downing mountain dews and never checking my sugar eating whatever I wanted. I gave up sodas, and fast food but finally have started checking my sugar as well. My endocrinologist has requested that I check my sugar randomly throughout the day and keep a record... well it has finally happened because of this app! üíï more"

      "review": "The app has a lot of decent features. The interface is cluttered to the point it‚Äôs hard to use and hard to find things. The reporting aspect of the app is poorly done, and that‚Äôs the most important part. In the free version, the ads after a day become so obnoxious that it‚Äôs fundamentally unusable. Full screen ads with the volume forced to 100% that offends everyone in the room. If you purchase this app you are funding a company that cares about monetizing the app far more than providing a good user experience. A premium subscription is VERY expensive, and honestly provides only a few real benefits, outside of removing the ads. I will look at EVERY alternative in the App Store before I feed this marketing tactic. There is a ‚Äúplus‚Äù version with a one time app purchase that likely removes some ads, but there is no clear statement of any difference so the only way to know is to buy it and find out. If you read enough review responses, you will learn if you buy that version you simply get another nagging form of encouragement to buy the expensive subscription. What this app provides is worth no where close to what the premium version provides. more"
