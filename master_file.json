When you have a lot of them it’s difficult to remember which ones you want to bring to your dermatologists attention. So just the option to mark a spot that maybe adds it to a separate folder so it’s easier to find so you can show your doctor instead of looking through them all. Otherwise a super useful and well thought out app. more"

The photos are all kept with the mole you placed and you can add more photos and notes. It keeps everything very organized and easy to check on mole changes.

This app provides so much information, it truly goes above and beyond! First of all, it gives you a good portion of the information for free and they don’t push the premium subscription either which is nice!!! While the premium version is nice the free version is very insightful and would work well for anyone who wants to know more about what there apple watch is tracking and how that data looks for your health. One of the best parts about this app is that if you do want to upgrade to the premium subscription you can choose which parts you want and only buy those, choose one of the package plans or buy the complete version which is a ONE TIME FEE!!! No monthly subscription!! Not to mention very budget and broke college student friendly as far as price :) It’s also surprisingly motivating when you really look at the details because it tracks your movement and then it tells you how many times you’ve worked out each month. It makes me want to bring that number up so my reports look better. more"

This apps free version is great already not completely stunted or loaded with ads it just works. And the paid upgrades are available separately or as a bundle more developers need to start doing this again. The upgrades ad more detail and longer records and more. I am buying the bundle to support this developer for doing this the not greedy way of subscriptions. ****update**** A whole 3 minutes later trying to support the developer I went to look at their other apps and the only other app, yeah it requires a subscription almost everything locked behind subscription. That’s their right but I have seen many times a paid app gets abandoned for a new subscription version. This leaves the paid version without updates or worse dead and the subscription app seems very similar to this one. Would love a response on what the plan is for this app before I buy. more"

For example, it averages daily heart rate over the course of a year. I got lazy over the enforced COVID stay at home period and quit exercising. A few months ago, I resumed exercising. The retrospective annual graph shows an increased heart rate during the period I slacked off and fortunately, a corresponding decline beginning when I resumed exercising. The feedback has motivated me to keep exercising. That alone is worth the purchase. The developer has an excellent User Interface sense. Want better detail on a part of a graph? Just pinch and zoom and you have it. You might think “Pfff! Pinch and zoom is not new!” You would be right but their are too many apps that don’t implement it when they should. This one does. The care that it took to implement that small detail permeates the app. Lots more but i hate writing on my phone. Just buy it. more"

Using a combination of multiple test algorithms, we developed the test, which consider a wide range of factors and is able to recognize smaller nuances than any other risk calculator. After completing a brief questionnaire with pictures, you would learn whether you have any suspicious pigment mark on your skin or whether there is a potential risk of melanoma. This user-friendly application excels in its simplicity of use and is a great aid in preventing this disease. About 30-50 % of melanomas develop from a pigment mark. Melanoma is a malignant tumour of melanocytes which mostly develops on the skin. It is one of the less frequent types of skin cancer, but causes the highest number of deaths from these tumour diseases. In most cases, the health symptoms are initial transformation of a static pigment mark, the early removal of which often prevents development of a malignant tumour. Get a test of your risk of developing melanoma thanks to this mobile application, since prevention is one of the most effective weapons against this disease. There is nothing simpler than to get examined by a dermatologist in case of any suspicion, rule out the risk of cancer, and be sure you are healthy.

I appreciate how I’ve been able to track my period through the years, as it’s been enormously helpful to my overall health, well-being, and awareness of my body. That being said, I have really struggled with the new updates that flo has undergone. Not only has the app become significantly less user-friendly, but the constant push to “go premium” has really negatively impacted my experience. I understand why they have a premium option, and I respect that it is there, but what I don’t respect is how I’m constantly being mislead in order to be trapped into signing up for a premium subscription. I find it really irresponsible that women who don’t want to pay for this app, will be given insights about their menstrual health, only to find out that they can’t have access to the information behave they don’t have an account! I used the chat feature a few times before, and it’ll leave me responding to chats for about 5 minutes, and right before they give me an answer about my health, they say I need to subscribe! It’s honestly cruel that an app meant to help women feel more secure about their health, is constantly misleading them like this, or trying to buy their desire for basic health info! Most of which can be googled, btw. I’ve really loved using flo, but am honestly considering shifting gears if things don’t change soon. more Hi mallalalalalalalalala, Thank you for sharing this.

I redownloaded the app once I started having periods again postpartum and every so many minutes within using the app, it prompts me to purchase the full subscription to be able to use even basic features that used to be available to everyone without purchase. In addition, when it prompts you to make a purchase, it literally forces you to agree and continue into the purchase by not allowing an exit button or anything to back out of the ad until you’re having to deny the purchase when it tries to ask for a payment method. It’s ridiculous that they are so money hungry that they now feel the need to try to force you into a purchase. It will also offer insight on your cycle but then pop up with an ad that you need to make a purchase to even see the insight. Other than being able to enter when you have your period and look back on the calendar, it is now a pointless app, I can literally use the calendar on my phone to do the same thing. more Hi there!

And the pregnancy side of things have been so good!!! I love opening it every day to find my new tips and advice for the day. It also helps me track my water, which I love. But, the new updates it has gone through have been sort of weird. It always prompts me to input my weight to track it, but that feature is gone! There is nowhere for me to input my weight anymore. Also, the chat feature is gone! I liked the “chat” at the beginning of every week even though you can only respond with pre written responses, it was very informative and useful. One week of pregnancy was incorrect (said I was week 8 even though I moved on to week 9) and it didn’t work because it knew something was wrong, and now I haven’t seen it since. Lastly, I loved all the of “stories” that it gave me during first trimester. A week to talk about exercise, a week for nutrition, a week for working while pregnant, etc. but as soon as second trimester hit, there’s nothing! I really looked forward to reading it everyday, but now there’s just a lack of information. I begin to wonder what I’m getting by paying “premium” because it sort of stopped all of the major things it was helping me with. But I loved it, so I’m mostly writing this review to let the creators know what they need to fix and bring back!! more Hi Jess brownie! We’re very sorry to hear that!

        "review": "When I first tried this product I thought that the cooling moisturizer was a good topper for skincare. Although my acne did reduce, I think I’d prefer products I can use on the daily, your $9 trial is a really good way for people to test your products and see if they’d want to continue using it on the long-term. Needless to say, the acne treatment cream is great and is good for me to use. Sometimes the products are a little tingly though which is fine, however I am on a time cramp in the morning and I like using daily products for sensitive skin, I have products that are not done yet so I will have to use those before trying more MDacne products. You are a great brand with good researchers. It is a little pricy for me to pay the $24 a month thing, but if you’re an adult working and have acne products I think it’s safe to try MDacne continuously and reduce products from different brands as to lower your sensitivity, they say continuity is key and that’s true for skincare, since this brand focuses on acne I hope more people become more confident with your products(acne can make people lose esteem but it’s okay, acne is natural and there’s always a remedy, don’t feel like hope is lost I just know that if your face isn’t super sensitive to customized skincare than that means you can overcome acne within a month to one year) more"

I messaged Dr. Harth about my concerns in hopes he could help me with it. He responded quickly and gave me some advice and a night cream to use every other night aside from my daily routine. If I’m being honest, I stopped using my day cream. I use my day/night wash and my night cream (before bed). I wake up, wash my face with cool water and use a moisturizer by neutrogena (clear face SPF30) break-out free liquid lotion sunscreen through out the day. Also great before foundation (if ever you decide to wear makeup). I’m not saying to stop using your day cream. Everyone’s skin is not the same, just like their skin care products. Whatever works for you, great! Don’t hesitate to message the Doctors if you can’t seem to find the right routine for you! Thank you McAcne! I’ve never felt so confident about my facial skin since middle school! I appreciate all the help I’ve received and I’m definitely gonna continue using your products!

Right in the beginning of using their products my skin started to get dry and worse but as time went on there has been a lot of improvement. Throughout 7 months I’ve been using it I’ve had times when my skin was at its best but then right after I thought everything was getting better. I got more and more breakouts. I’ve seen a big improvement in my skin from when I first started. Everyone’s skin is different but the process takes time and it’s definitely worth it. I still do have acne now and acne scars but it’s way better than before. The staff are great and help me with all my questions I have about my skin or about other products on the app. Although I’m still unhappy with how my face looks I still gotta wait until it gets better. The products really do help and work but IT TAKES TIME. So don’t be all mad when your skin doesn’t clear up in the first month because it’s not how it’s works.

        "review": "The three C’s related to superb patient care include caring professionals, compassion and communication. Klara expedites the communication process in an extremely efficient manner that my patients really appreciate. We are able to communicate with our patients in an efficient user friendly manner that reduces or eliminates phone call waiting time and expedites the process for everyone involved. Our staff send patients their referral information via Klara, communicate about missed appointments through Klara, and send patients treatment plans, lab work data and other test results via Klara to name just a few of the benefits. Voice phone call messages are transcribed into Klara text messages which our staff can more efficiently respond to. We found that our electronic health record patient portal system was too cumbersome to use. Less than 10% of our patients got enrolled and utilized the system. When we switched to Klara, we achieved greater than an 80% utilization rate by our patients. Regardless of the patient’s computer skills and educational background, we were able to enroll them in less than 30 seconds compared to over five minutes with the patient portal. In summary, Klara has been a great asset to our medical practice and has become our go to #1 patient communication/engagement software tool. If you’re looking for a more efficient tool to communicate with your patients, I would highly recommend looking at Klara. more"

I called Friday with a problem about my pain medicines that needed a refill for the next month. For some unknown reason, my refills had been sent to a new and unknown pharmacy, even though my medical file listed my pharmacy as Walgreens in Collinsville. The new pharmacy was a small one, and didn’t have one of my medicines. They knew they could order the medicine, but there was a minimum order to deal with. Pharmacies must dispose of expired medicines, and loose money if this happens often. The owner of the pharmacy requested that I get my prescriptions at my regular pharmacy. Fine by me, since they were also more expensive. This problem happened again this month! I have been trying to get them to move my scripts using Klara, but I have been ignored since Friday. Hey! These are medicines I need to control my pain! This is not making me very happy! more"

To my most recent experience, post surgery with Nurse Karen, answering all my questions with such detail and love - early morning, late night and weekends calls and texts. You are always in touch with someone who can help you, if needed. And Dr. Sanders… I felt totally comfortable with his kind approach and his vision for me as well as hearing what I wanted. I was 100% confident in his care. I am still healing, however, I saw the results immediately and each day going forward, I see the results and they are fabulous. I did not want to look 25… rather, to look refreshed and natural. Also, I highly recommend you go to Norma’s Cottage for aftercare … they are angels. I am more than happy to give Dr. Sanders and his entire Team the highest of recommendations! And I am happy to talk to anyone about my procedures and my experience. Ask Suzy for my number. Good luck, do it, you’ll feel so much more confident and happy. Best always, Mary FitzGerald more"

I am not normally one to review since I’m pretty patient and understand things happen but wow this has been an awful experience! There’s been so much run around. There’s no quick explanation I can give, so here’s the full story: When they first called, I couldn’t hear anything on the other line. No big deal, I get that glitches happen. But when I got a call saying they’d tried calling back and I wasn’t answering when the doctor called, I started to get a little irritated. I wasn’t getting any calls. They called later to give me the same speech. I was like please just connect me since obviously they’re not getting through. When I was connected I could barely hear the doctor, so I wasn’t even sure who I was talking to. He seemed to get irritated with me, and then just prescribed me something, I’m not sure what, and hung up. Mind you, I’m at work while this is all going down. I have to keep getting up from my desk on a very busy day to take care of this. Then, my phone starts absolutely blowing up. Call after call. I reject them because I’m very busy and tired of the back and forth, but they keep calling. After about 8 rejected calls I answer. And of course, there’s nobody on the line.

Now, HealthJoy does this all for me by not only looking at providers’ reviews but their proximity to where I live, hospital affiliation, and checking to see if they are in-network as well and even offers to make appointments for me!

I would choose a happy face or sad face depending on my mood and leave a short blurb of the day sometimes. It was easy enough for me to do and didn’t require that much effort so building the habit of early journaling was easy. little by little I added activities so I didn’t necessarily even have to type anything but could just choose an activity I did, it helped me begin to be able to track what was making me happy and what was making me sad and spotting the consistency of these activities correlating with my moods. Almost 6 years later, my journal entries have become very detailed. If I’m trying to recall what I did days, weeks, or even months ago, I have the resource to find it. Daylio is become the single most important app on my phone because it’s help me establish a record of my life. The continued updates have made it worth buying the premium version. You don’t require subscription to use it as so many other apps and services nowadays have become obsessed with bleeding consumers dry. I recommend this app to anybody who feels like they’re in a rut, to anyone who needs an eye-opening self reflection tool. Do you want to get a better understanding of your habits and who you are as a person? This app can be your greatest resource to do so. more"

I use this app to help track my anxiety and how I feel leading up to an anxious period as well as other moods. I love that I can go back and add entries even days later if I forgot. I also love that it’s completely customizable and I can have tons of options. I did end up upgrading to premium to unlock unlimited moods and activities because I find it really beneficial and absolutely worth the around $20 a year. I have an activities folder with ranges for my heart rate so so can track that during an anxiety attack, I have one with different physical symptoms like sweaty, dizzy, etc., and even a folder for methods and techniques I’ve already tried to calm down. I hate having to type out every little thing so being able to just go through and simply pick what applies at the moment is great. The small comment section is great as well if I want to add a small note about something that might be important but not frequent enough for its own button. This app is really fantastic for helping track moods and keeping a record of how I am feeling and when in an easy to use format that’s customizable to every person, even down to the color scheme. I started off simply looking for an app where I could have more than one daily entry but this app goes above and beyond. more"

        "review": "I have always loved to journal and document both important and mundane days in my life. It’s easy to do with this app, even if you only have a few minutes to check in with yourself to see how you are feeling. All you do is click a few buttons to record what you’ve been doing and how you feel, the app records the time stamp and you’re done! Or if you have more time you can add text too - a little or a lot - I’ve written paragraphs at times. As someone diagnosed bipolar over 20 years ago, using this app is a great way to track moods (I too am in to the popular “mindfulness” trend, even before it became popular): it allows me to pause throughout the day, take a few minutes to sit quietly, notice how my body feels, see what kind of feelings my thoughts bring up in me, and then record that snapshot. Then, at any time I can look at the app’s simple reports that show a variety of trends in you activities and mood over a given period of time. I may think, “wow, I’ve been down and frustrated a lot lately” and then look over the report for the month and see that I actually had a lot of really positive times too. It helps me focus on the positive and work on training my brain not to go automatically to the negative. With practice, our brains CAN be rewired that way! I’ve done it successfully with a couple different things I wanted to change. Anyway, try the app. It’s great! more"

The app assists you with tracking skin and moles over time with a photo diary. We do not think that with today’s technology, and the present quality of smartphone images, that it is possible to provide AI diagnoses of melanoma or skin cancer risk. If you find a mole or mark that looks concerning you should always consult a certified doctor. THE VISION OF MIISKIN Miiskin’s vision is to help you keep track of skin changes and increase access to dermatology care in the most user-friendly way possible.

Some exercises are just made for people who are fit, young or both. At the beginning the exercises are modified to a beginner, but then they get more challenging. The problem is that after months of exercising when you’re overweight and older, your knees start feeling the pain, so I do recommend they stay on a modified exercise when it comes to putting all the weight on your knees or giving you the option within the app. Also, it’s important to provide two feel good options because it helps you achieve that goal for that day, and also you have an option for those days when your life was crazy busy, active, and full of chaos. Lastly, I have had many problems of it crashing down in the middle of my workout many, many times! This also discourages all the effort we put into a healthier lifestyle. I have even tried it several times, but it constantly crashes down. Also, I can’t even delete and reinstall the app because it might delete all my data. No easy fix for this until now. more Hello!

        "review": "With gyms closed, I decided to look for alternate at home exercises. I am in my late 20s and looking to keep an active and healthy lifestyle. This app has great options. I subscribed and I really enjoy the daily 'do your exercises' that fit directly in what I am looking for. I also like the 'workouts' section if I am looking to work a little more on a specific muscle group. Yet, for me honestly I do feel that the food and dietary section is not useful to me. I am not looking for nutritional advice, im only looking for workout ideas so this to me is not useful. I would advice BetterMe to have a full seperate app just for nutrition and one just for workouts with the possibility of merging data from both apps together if the user wants to. Otherwise, a lot of the data on this is just not useful to some people. I do get the whole concept of being a full plan of food and exercise but thats my experience. Another think I want to point out is the 'do your workouts' section of the Plan page. Some days it recommends walking, other days it recommends a full 25 minute exercise routine -which is exactly what i love about this app and why I subscribed to it. Yet, skme days when i check the 'do your workout' section it says 'today walking' it doesn't make sense. I suggest modifying the Plan page to include under the 'do your workouts' section a 'walking' subsection and an 'exercises' subsection. That way you get to have both new options everyday. more Hello! We appreciate you taking the time to let us know what you’re looking for — most of the improvements we make come from ideas and suggestions like yours.

        "review": "After my first workout, I deleted the app and decided this wasn’t for me. I have EDS Hypermoble type, which to put simply means my joints and connective tissue are not stable. After my first set of exercises, I’d manage to subluxate both my shoulders and my hips, and was bed bound for several hours. There’s a reason I do exercises under supervision, either from my physical therapist, or when I can afford it, a personal trainer who’s fully aware of my condition. However, I brought up trying the app with my physical therapist, and he was very supportive of the idea of trying wall Pilates at home. He had me redownload the app, and after our session went through the individual exercises with me that I’d had trouble with. (side note, BEST PT ever, I am so happy to have found him.) He helped me find ways to modify them so they were safe for me, or on a couple said “that’s not for you, I don’t feel comfortable with you doing that”. Reminded me to always keep in mind slow and controlled, to not try for full extension since that’s when I tend to over-extend. I’ve now done my third workout, and I’m optimistic. While ideally I’d love to lose weight, right now I’m focusing on feeling better, and more in control of my unpredictable body. I’m excited to see that there are so many different types of workouts. My goal for now is 3 times a week. I still have a lot to explore, and see how if effects and hopefully helps me! more Hello! Thanks for sharing your situation openly.

The gender selection options, the button to agree to the terms of service and the button to register are not clickable.

I also use the CPAP that this company makes so I have the app that tells me how I’m doing with that as well. But I wish that they could make them one app since they both measure different things. This one uses the sound waves/sonar and the other one tells you how your use of the CPAP went. But they are not the same. Some nights I take off the CPAP without thinking and then it stops tracking my sleep even though I’m still asleep. Would be nice to have both wrapped up into one app (set your wake time and have it start tracking your sleep when you start the CPAP) and get both scores with the premium membership included because you bought the machine and continue to buy the supplies. Just a thought. I’m still looking for one place to track my sleep and teach me how to do it better.

When I first started using the app I noticed I was getting less than 30min of REM sleep a night and not enough deep sleep either. When I was able to get more REM sleep I noticed I felt much better and energy is improved overall. So as I’ve been using the app to increase my REM and deep sleep, my overall functioning has gotten better. Of course it’s not a cure for my chronic illness but has made a big difference! And for anyone with ME/CFS, you know that little bit better functioning is actually huge! It’s relatively low cost, the free version has worked fine but I paid for the subscription to save my data. It’s surprisingly accurate too. I can see when I wake up what kind of day I will be having now based on the data and knowing my body. The sleep score doesn’t always mean I feel well rested/alert because of my individual health issues but I can tell if I have enough sleep including rem and deep sleep that it will correlate to better functioning. more Thank you very much for your 5-star review!!!

It’s a little picky about how/where you have it placed so it can “detect” you and track throughout the night, but once you find a good position close enough to you it’s good. My only real feedback I would give right now is that there doesn’t seem to be a way to adjust the volume on my device in regard to the smart alarm feature. I really like this feature and I feel it has reduced my grogginess upon waking, but the app seems to have a default volume level for the alarm that is significantly louder than it needs to be, especially considering how close your device is in order to track your sleep! My husband is not usually woken up by my alarms but this one is so loud that it has woken him up a few times, and when I try to turn it down on my phone, the app moves the volume level right back up. Maybe this is just a bug that could be fixed? I would definitely recommend this app as it does have a lot of really good features and is a really good learning tool, but it does still have just some general bugs to be worked out. more Hi, thank you for providing your feedback. We are so happy to hear that you are liking the app, and that you have found the optimal setup for your room.

Luckily I have another app for my care team but I liked babyscripts because it kept me updated on growth and tips for each week. more Thank you for your feedback, and congratulations on your pregnancy!

They got back to me overnight confirming it was indeed concerning and to get it biopsied with sufficient margins. The dermatologist I saw in person wasn’t aware of Scanoma and said he wouldn’t trust an app and that I should be more worried about another lesion I had. He therefore biopsied both but only the one Scanoma predicted concerning came out a malignant melanoma stage 0. To be fair, I didn’t use Scanoma to scan the other one, but still, the app held its own! I caught the cancer in time, so it’s no exaggeration to say the app helped save my life. I’ve also used the app’s predictions as evidence to push for getting the best post-diagnosis care possible. PSA: Please search for IMPACT Melanoma for more information on what to do if you’re ever in my situation and never continue with a general/cosmetic dermatologist if you get diagnosed with any type or stage of Melanoma.

Unfortunately, I cannot get the camera to focus at all no matter what I do or what lighting is used. It’s very frustrating because I have two places that look like my past melanomas, but the camera won’t pick up the multiple colors within the lesion or the irregular border. In the pictures, they look like normal freckles. If you have a history of melanoma, just save yourself the trouble and try to get to the dermatologist. Unfortunately, I am the caregiver of a disabled child who is in and out of the hospital, so that’s not that easy for me to go as often as I need. I will check back in a few weeks and see if they’ve updated the app. I see I’m not the only one who has this problem after reading through reviews. It’s not my phone either; I can take very clear pictures with my camera. Unfortunately, you can’t upload anything to this app. That is frustrating as well. more"

        "review": "This app has a lot of promise based on the UI but way too many issues. 1) For some reason you can’t edit the actual initial setup of a goal afterward (like the icon or color, or scale). Yes you can adjust the goal metrics but what if I want to change how it’s configured? 2) There are two seemingly “default” goals (mood and energy). I didn’t see how to delete them, but rather “hide them”. Hiding them made them disappear into somewhere I wouldn’t know where to look if I wanted them shown again. 3) Metric scale doesn’t have ability to count 0 (therefore making something like counting number of drinks, with 0 being the goal, impossible. 4) Even the feedback form in the app seems faulty. Tried to use it but every time I tried to press return for a new bullet the form disappeared. Unsure if it was submitting or just closing out. 5) The graphs are a good start but I’d like to see a daily chart as well, not just weekly or monthly. For a paid app this just falls way short. Canceled my trial. more Hi Ctelle1234 - thank you for your feedback, we really appreciate your thorough review of our app. We're constantly updating our service to ensure the experience our users are getting is always evolving and improving.

However, it pretty much says every result is concerning or has a high cancer risk. For example I have benign seborrheic keratosis on my arm that I’ve had since I was a teenager and it said my cancer risk was 85% and I needed to run to a dermatologist. Even a quick google search will tell you seborrheic keratosis are not pre-cancerous. Yet, they say it is a huge cancer risk. They also diagnosed me with lentigo on my arm saying it was most likely (74%) precancerous when Lentigo is, by the books, harmless but can resemble dangerous lesions. Then they try to get you to pay for a “dermatologist” of theirs opinion. Just go to the doctor or monitor your own skin and go with your instinct. This will only make anxiety flair. more We are sorry that you did not like our application.

To my surprise, the app tells me there's a 90% chance I have squamous cell carcinoma and that I need to see a dermatologist immediately. My cut has since healed and was nothing more than a small bump. I can understand the principle of overestimating these things, but the fact that this app charges you for what is more likely than not to be a misdiagnosis is disgusting. If you're really concerned about a spot on your skin, don't bother with this and just go straight to your physician. more Thank you for sharing your experience.

I wish I could just enter numbers instead of being forced to scroll. I can't find out what things like \"quinoa salad\" contain so I can't judge which selection is most correct to what I ate for dinner. I can't enlarge the page to full screen on my iPad, which is annoying because it would work better for me if I could. It's not the worst health app I've ever used, bit it is definitely on the lower end of the list. I likely won't renew. Update: I've been using the app for about a week. I'm taking off a star. This app is ridiculously difficult to use. Worse, it freezes up all the time. The inability to enter custom numbers is a huge problem. The app is awkward and clunky, and fully half or more of what I log is likely inaccurate because there is almost no customizing available. If I was simply dieting, this wouldn't be a huge problem (although annoying nonetheless), but I'm using this app because I'm prediabetic, and accuracy is vital.

        "review": "I only use the Owlet Dream Sock and although I am pleased with the sock itself and it’s designed purpose of helping keep my mind at ease while my baby sleeps, I am not impressed with the app itself. It takes several “refreshes” and even closing and re-opening the app in order to see the current sleep state. I wish the app would provide some sort of chart that shows awake, light and deep sleep patterns. My Apple Watch tells me more about my sleep patterns than the Owlet does for my baby. Lastly there should be some sort of turn off or check-in button when it’s having “difficulty getting readings”. There will be times where I’m holding my baby, I know he’s fine and even though I dismiss the notification the base will still continue to sound and it’s frustrating. Also I had to move the base to his actual changing table because otherwise when I take it off the base as I’m getting him ready for bed the sock will start alarming if I don’t put it on asap. I’ll snooze the base and it will literally go off in what feels like another minute. There could maybe be some sort of, ready to start tracking sleep button. Overall, the sock does it’s job of keeping track of my baby’s heart rate, oxygen level and sleep status but doesn’t do much more than that. You’d think for $300 the app would be better. more"

        "review": "This app needs serious improvement. It claims to “clinacally proven, medical grade accuracy” which is true, as long as you can get the app to stay open long enough to load the levels. The app is constantly quitting while in the middle of “loading” my babies vitals and sleep state. It takes 10 or so minutes to update the current sleep state. And often times, I click on my babies profile to see the sleep state and it shows there is no sock connected, causing me to reset everything at 1:00, 2:00, 3:00 in the morning. The range from sock to base is not designed for bigger houses. When we bring our babies from their room to the living room, the base will beep at you constantly because of connectivity issues. And our living room is the same distance as their room. Even if you turn the base off completly, it seems to still beep after a few minutes of getting readings. And when it is beeping at you, trying to open the app takes even longer so I’m sitting there overstimulated with a screaming baby and a phone & base that won’t stop beeping because the app takes FOREVER to load. I love that this is designed to alert me and to keep my baby safe and I will say it has helped me get better sleep since my twins were born. But we spent almost $700 on these two owlet socks. For that money, this app should be working way better than what it is. Do better, Owlet. Do way way better. more Hello from the Engineering team at Owlet.

I will say the sock is a great idea giving your baby's heart rate and oxygen level, however, it causes more anxiety when not working and how poorly supported it is by the app. The way it works in regards to the charging station, the location of where it needs to be, and troubleshooting any connection issue is the most annoying and inconvenient. The sock needs to be in the charging station when not in use or else you set off the alerts, and that is also where the alerts noise comes in as well as the app, so you can't have it near a sleeping baby and there is no off button on it (there is snooze) or else levels are not monitored and the app reflects as base station off, in other words not reading levels. We have it outside of the nursery and have to run back and forth when putting it on baby. Just another step in our bed/nap time routine at this point. I continue to use it because when it works it's awesome and I love to see how his hr/O2 fluctuates between sleep cycles, just frustrated with the poor connectivity to the app and the troubleshooting anxiety that one has to go through to get back online/refreshing app especially at 3 am when you are already sleep deprived. more"

I’ve put off getting my thyroid levels checked for way too long and Im very thankful my medical provider due to a construction issue with their normal on-site lab facilities recommended using the at-home test kit instead of going to a traditional lab location across town. I’ll never have an excuse to delay getting testing done! Kit was so well put together and simple! It came complete with all needed supplies and thanks to the super easy to use video-instructions,with their helpful App even my nine year old was able to walk me through the steps and she loved being able to help! The coolest part was the “check my sample” step which used a photo to check that my sample was done correctly which eliminated all stress. I was very thankful for that step to make sure that it’s done correctly. Coolest test ever! Thank you Everlywell- I will definitely be utilizing more of your other test kits and will be telling friends and family to find your kits too!

        "review": "This app functions well, but too bad it is for a worthless product. It does not provide numbers, just a positive (or negative) response. The “support” they offer is a call center rep telling you that the results are positive and go to the doctor. I didn’t ask for a definitive diagnosis, but selling this as offering support is deceptive marketing, if not outright lying. You can talk to a “provider” but it is just a mid-level who cannot diagnose. I can read “positive” and “talk to a doctor” without a call center rep or paying a midlevel to read it to me. What is the point of a test not providing numbers and ranges?! Are they just randomly throwing out positives and negatives in results?! Further, my doctor (actual DO who uses a reputable lab) repeated the testing and my results were NOT positive, not even close to positive. In fact, not only was I NOT positive on the one thing they said I was, I WAS positive on the thing they said I was not! Total joke and waste of money. Very deceptive marketing. Other reputable labs will do many of these same tests for cash pay and actually provide numbers and resources to understand numbers. What a joke. more Hi!

I scanned like 10 things then it said I have to pay, I don’t know about y'all, but I was really looking forward to finally finding a free beauty scanning app. I was so tired of looking it up on google and not finding anything so I downloaded this. I only rated it 5 stars so everyone can see this. I would have rated it three. Like I was saying, it is a great app but I had to delete it because I didn’t really want to pay to keep my skin safe. I have really bad acne and loved the quizzes and stuff to find out what helps me but I hate that I have to pay to do it. I overall love this app and would download it again if it was like 100% free. This was probably the best one I have tried but again, IS NOT FREE! Wish I could actually find one that is free or if this one was free I would love it more than I already do, I hope On Skin reads this comment and if you do On Skin please please please comment on it.

        "review": "I love this app. I downloaded it randomly for… SOME reason idk- but it actually helped me out a lot. I’ve tested this on my very tiny skincare collection (if you can even call it that?) which consists of a moisturizer and a really good face wash, and it told me multiple good things and 1-2 bad things. I ended up doing some research on these ingredients, and most of it happened to be true. But then I deleted it because I didn’t need it anymore… Until I met a really good hair care friend who used a similar looking app. Then I thought to write this review. (Ah yes, my ADHD brain…) And I read a review or two, but there were multiple I didn’t read except the first couple sentences. 2/3 of them said that it gave them different answers each time they scanned and told them their products (which they described as amazing) were making their skin dry. So now I am questioning… Anyways, this really helped me, but I have a feeling that since everyone’s skin type is different, everyone’s skin reacted different to it, making the app ‘untrustworthy’. So, in conclusion, this app is fine, but because it doesn’t review your skin in person (or even a simple questionnaire), it’s not as accurate as a real dermatologist. more"

Also it can still be a good match for your skin type regardless. I feel like a lot of the negative reviews don’t understand that part. For example- The cetaphil healthy radiance serum is a 49% safety but a good match for my skin. i use this product often and i love it, but reading the ingredient definitions just made me aware of any risks. I haven’t had issues with the serum- but that doesn’t mean it won’t harm someone else’s skin. I imagine this helps with finding out what ingredients someone is more sensitive/ allergic to. Also, there is a free version! i have used plenty of scans with no bumps in the road so far. more"

        "review": "Epocrates is my go to App because it is clear and concise and to the point and I can find what I need quickly. I also have another App that is very thorough and shows you studies etc... but personally when I’m taking care of patients I don’t have time to read a study- I need clear, simple and quick answers and that is what Epocrates offers. I’ve used it since NP school and haven’t found anything else that I like better. I’ve worked in the primary care/urgent care setting. The only thing that I would want that Epocrates doesn’t offer (I don’t believe) is A little more info on IV drugs for instance “this should be a slow push over 2 minutes”... obviously we don’t do that in an outpatient setting but when I worked in the hospital those extra tips would have been helpful- I would feel like Epocrates truly had it all of they added that! more"

        "review": "I try to refrain from leaving negative reviews but this is the second time I've been left \"stuck\" without an answer to a question relying on Epocrates' mobile app. I am a paying customer and I feel that the same quality that goes into your online version should be integrated into your useless mobile app. As a pharmacist I sometimes have questions about dosage forms, medication strengths, formulation types, etc etc. Case in point, today I needed to quickly determine which form of olopatidine is designed for once daily dosing v. twice daily dosing. Simple stuff. I type in Pataday. The mobile app shows \"Pataday\". I click on it just to be fed to a blank page that says \"now OTC\"!? Great, where's the other information. So I search generic name where it has so truncated the information that you can't really use it as needed. For example, it lists generic name then both strengths of olopatidine but doesn't differentiate which correlates to the brand, and in this case, drug strength you're looking for. It may sound trivial but this happens often using their mobile site. And don't get me started on finding pK info and any meaningful pregnancy and lactation information on the web app. I really think that for paying users you should create a web version of the online Epocrates platform. I found that very useful in pharmacy school, on rotations, etc. I need that as a mobile friendly version! more Thank you for your feedback! We're very sorry for the trouble you've experienced!

The Highlights and Basics, Tests, DDx, and Tx tabs under the Quick Reference sections of specific diseases—along with a pharmaceutical dictionary—are indispensable. I truly feel this app makes daily clinical practice easier, smoother, and safer for patients and providers. The ONLY gripe I have about this app is that the News pops up throughout the day, prompting me to click on Headlines before I search for what I need to know, and this is on the PAID version. You are supposed to be able to search for what you need to know from this obligatory News screen. And that would be fine. If it worked. But 9/10 it doesn’t, you can’t, and the app crashes/stalls. I’ve emailed twice about this through the app and received personalized replies, but I could tell they were meaningless…and the issue still hasn’t been resolved. The app is otherwise perfect and if it were a matter of resolving this “issue”/improving the functionality of the app or risk losing the functionality currently available, I would not risk it. That’s how much I value this app. more"

        "review": "The app has a lot of decent features. The interface is cluttered to the point it’s hard to use and hard to find things. The reporting aspect of the app is poorly done, and that’s the most important part. In the free version, the ads after a day become so obnoxious that it’s fundamentally unusable. Full screen ads with the volume forced to 100% that offends everyone in the room. If you purchase this app you are funding a company that cares about monetizing the app far more than providing a good user experience. A premium subscription is VERY expensive, and honestly provides only a few real benefits, outside of removing the ads. I will look at EVERY alternative in the App Store before I feed this marketing tactic. There is a “plus” version with a one time app purchase that likely removes some ads, but there is no clear statement of any difference so the only way to know is to buy it and find out. If you read enough review responses, you will learn if you buy that version you simply get another nagging form of encouragement to buy the expensive subscription. What this app provides is worth no where close to what the premium version provides. more"

Recently any action generates numerous error popups indicating a connection or network problem. I deleted the app and reinstalled the latest version from the App Store but now even trying to login generates a connection or server error. Fortunately I am able to access the UTD web site, but there have been several circumstances where I have been in areas without WiFi or cell service under emergency conditions and unable to access the offline content due to need to update the offline content. Certainly if one cannot login or access information, especially under urgent medical situations, the app is not useful so I can’t justify more than one star if the app doesn’t work. My advice to many others out there who also have this problem is don’t buy individual subscriptions and just use institutional accounts when connected to a work machine and look to other reliable apps that offer offline content when in need of urgent medical information ( and there are many). Our practice and affiliated hospitals no longer use UTD because of unreliable access issues. The quality of medical care in the USA has deteriorated due to problems with technology and this is another example of a chronic technology problem afflicting many that UTD does not appear capable of repairing.

I ended up using pediatric renal dosing of a medication instead of adult renal dosing because it jumped to the wrong section and the table didn’t have a title to identify that it was for pediatric instead of adults.

I often will pull up a known diagnosis and show the patient similar photos to their condition from the expansive photo bank to help support a diagnosis. Furthermore, i frequently print out patient handouts for patients so that they have a reliable and physician-vetted document to help answer any questions that remain after our patient encounter.

        "review": "I have been using this ap for nearly a week after my gastroenterologist suggested I keep a food and symptom diary. I don’t want to have to do this but if I am going to invest the time, I want to have useful data. This ap allows a lot of individualization, both of data type as well as granularity. It is taking a little longer to figure out how to optimally use than a less customizable ap but I greatly appreciate having this flexibility. So, e.g., if I want to list only 2 items for a day, such as “coffee” and “heartburn” I could do that. Or if I want to list detailed ingredients and quantities and exact times with free text comments in multiple categories, I can also do that. If over time I realize I need to go more or less granular or add or subtract a category, I can do that. After using for a few days, the selectable entries became much quicker as the ap defaults to listing prior entries as available selections for subsequent days. If you are like me, you are taking some of the same meds and supplements and eating many of the same foods each day. I don’t have enough data yet for extensive analysis yet but look forward to exploring these features more as well. There is a wealth of information available here, so far it has been well worth the time I have invested. more"

The functionality is amazing— so much more than you’d expect for an inexpensive little app. The ability to toggle on/off certain configurations / ways the algorithm works / analysis period to find top suspects— is evidence of the care and pride into this app. I could not believe when I went on vacation, the times of each entry changed for that day, so I didn’t have to do any more work (ie, pretending to be on a different timezone that day) so my “X hours after” ingestion values weren’t wrecked— it just worked, without any human adjustment needed! Clearly someone has thought long and hard about every scenario, and taken steps to address it in the app. I think the ability to either create a new recipe or replace all previous instances of the recipe with your new entry is essential, and without it, I doubt the results would ever be accurate. Basically I’m blown away by this app!!!! I should note that I find technology intuitive in general. If you want a more beginner’s app, and you’re willing to trade functionality for ease of learning the app, maybe you’d want to choose a different one. Personally I’m so glad I didn’t.

WOW AND BRAVO guys, superb achievement, you need to be proud of your work, it tremendously helps people like me with real bad lifelong symptoms of a disease that must be controlled by using such a tool that keeps track of everything so perfectly. Best thing about it is it’s simplicity and ease to amend, correct, add data backdated, improve our records, and even add new items that currently do not exist in the database. Thank you developers, great job!! more"

        "review": "The last time I used this app was in 2017. I recently read an email telling me to go back on so I did and I remember now why I stopped using it. It just doesn’t inspire me at all and there are no pictures of restaurants. Also, I mainly logged in to write a review for a restaurant that I’ve been visiting for the last few days. It is a new family operation that just opened their doors this year. I can understand how it’s not on here but there’s no way for me to add it. I think if google maps was integrated into the app somehow like I’ve seen some vegan apps do, it would make it a lot easier to search restaurants that are current. I am kind of disappointed I wasn’t able to leave a review for my favorite healthy sandwich shop and keep Allergy Eats going though. I really do hope the app improves one day because I know it can be the best. I’m looking forward to seeing what’s next. more We're sorry that you had a disappointing experience, and we understand. We're constantly looking for critical feedback and trying to improve the best we can. So thank you.With regards to not being able to rate a restaurant not on the site/app, we do have a link to \"Add a Restaurant\" under the \"more\" tab on the app. Frankly, the turnover in restaurants is always quite high, and much more so during the year of COVID. While we are taking steps to improve the accuracy of our listings going into 2021, we still rely on our community to help us in new and closed restaurants. If you click on Add a Restaurant and send the info to us, we will add it almost immediately to our database and then send you a return email letting you know it's ready for your review. I hope you'll take advantage of this. As you know, AllergyEats relies on user reviews - and finding positive reviews on new restaurants, especially during the pandemic, is even more valuable!With respect to other changes, while we believe in continuous improvement - and continue to practice that day-to-day - as you can imagine, we've been impacted by the pandemic quite dramatically, along with restaurants and travel. That said, we've upgraded our menu displays and look forward to more substantial improvements as people become more comfortable dining out again.Thank you again for your feedback and we'd of course love for you to reconsider your review. While the issues you raise of welcomed and valid, we still think the core of what we provide - thanks to you and all raters - is extremely positive for the food allergy community, in order to find allergy-friendly restaurants wherever they travel. more"

Highlighted results when my dbp (diastolic) or sbp (systolic) aren't in target range allows me to see quickly those variations which could signal a need for further attention or evaluation. So easy to add the data. Scroll to numbers rather than type in, weight can be adjusted anytime & notes can be added each reading. (Used to be an app whereby I could hold my iPhone to my chest for BP. Found it reliably close yo a BP machine. I deleted it only bc it wasn’t updated to current iPhone IOS. Miss that portable BP “cuff”.) Glad to use this app. Recommend for those wishing to maintain feedback for themselves OR their doctor bc info can be exported to another source for review.

A bit pricey (not going to be a $20 copay like a regular ol doctor visit) but it is SOOO worth it. Literally you can talk to a doctor either through video chat, phone, or text. I’m very anti social lol so I was so glad to just be able to text back and forth right away. No getting dressed, driving to the doctors office, waiting to be seen, etc. it’s literally right on your phone. For mild illnesses where you pretty much know what’s wrong & what you need but can’t get because it’s prescription only, this is great. I already knew what was going on with me & needed diflucan because OTC treatments don’t work for me. Told the doc my symptoms, he asked some questions, etc. and within about 5 minutes he sent a script over for diflucan to the pharmacy that I use & boom I picked it up an hour later. Love it. So much better than waiting a week just to get an appointment for my doctor, dragging myself there when I’m already miserable from whatever I got going on, & then waiting to be seen. more Hi there brina.124! Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review, we really appreciate it. We're so happy to hear that you found connecting with a doctor through HealthTap both convenient and enjoyable.

That report only offers a color coded intensity - does not even include the average number for a more precise information. Also does not provide the most basic of analytics or insights like “on days you woke up without an alarm these symptoms were less”. You can compare symptom by symptom but only two at a time and only one day. Factors is also useless as it does not interact with the symptoms data at all, it might as well be part of the journal. When I messaged to ask about this they stated we don’t get into analyzing because it could be diagnosis. If you don’t offer diagnosis (an actual condition) and slap on the same warning like every other health app does then you aren’t diagnosing anything. It seems like an easy way to not do the work of actually processing the data in a meaningful way. This was a huge disappointment and I regret paying for this app and would like my money back. more"

        "review": "So I originally got this app with my 1st pregnancy, but I didn’t pay for the premium because at the time I thought it was bonkers to pay $4.99 for a pregnancy app when all the other pregnancy apps are free. I decided to purchase the app with my current pregnancy back when so found out I was pregnant in August 2020. I KNOW I paid for the app because I would not have been able to use a majority of the features however.... when I decided that I wanted to make a birth plan and use the app to do it, it says I have to purchase the premium for $1.99 which I couldn’t understand because I paid $4.99 for premium. Every once in a while I’ll have apps that do this so I’ll just tap “restore” and it restores my purchase and everything is fine. NOT WITH THIS APP. I tapped “restore” and a message pops up that says “Alert: You have not purchased the app.” YES I HAVE PURCHASED THE APP. This leads me to think that even though you have to pay $4.99 for the premium, there is also an additional $1.99 charge for the premium that they have snuck in making this app actually $6.98. Phillips what are you doing???? more Sorry to hear you are having problems with restoring your purchase. Please select the Feedback button in the More section of the App to reach our customer service team. They can help you get this sorted! We appreciate your patience. more"

        "review": "UPDATE: I just began tracking my weight and exercise. It’s amazing. It’s A MUST HAVE! I was previously using the Accu-check application for several years, even though I had also downloaded this one. My original view of the application, was that it wouldn’t automatically transfer the previous data stored on my device, or from the online database. I had unfortunately missed the sunset deadline to manually make the transition, I had temporarily stopped tracking my sugar, which was a big mistake. By the time I remembered why I keep feeling spacey was probably due to either a sugar high or an excessive low, which was mostly the case. I quickly found out that my favorite app “Accu-Check” was retired and replaced with the “My Sugar” app. I had missed the Free “PRO transfer offer period”, and proceeded to set-up and sink my account and device. I was quickly pleased, after syncing my device, I found that everything stored on my monitor transferred completely. I was so excited. I have since explored the app, and see where I can add additional details about my day, including my current weight, pictures of meals, how I feel and more. This is one of the absolute best Sugar apps on the market, which works with a large variety’s of blood glucose meters! more"

Being able to see and really analyze what causes the ups and downs in my blood sugar, and really think about what is happening at that moment I’m logging a reading. Im by no means an expert on the subject of how to properly manage this disease. But now I have a much greater understanding of all the conditions, aswell as the actions that can contribute to me feeling great or terrible. I’ve been in denial for some time of what causes the good or bad days. This highly animated app gives a very reasonable and realistic approach to wanting to dig into the data. It’s only as good as what you log. And how honest you can be with yourself, and hold yourself accountable to logging the truth about your day, your activities, stresses, mood, anxiety, and poor food/drink decisions. Something as simple as seeing and comparing how different levels of activity affect your blood sugar is not only good in real time, but also to be able to go back and identify patterns, good, bad, and sometimes the ugly. This app has served me well, and I am grateful for it. Hopefully you will see the positives for yourself as well. Cheers to your good path to better health. more"

        "review": "I used an old app for many years but eventually it became incompatible with latest iOS and I had to change. I tried 6 different apps and this one trounced the competition at the time. That was 3 years ago, and since then, the app has gotten better in many ways. This service and development teams are incredible. Super-responsive, they understand when you have issues and and I’m constantly impressed with how quickly they’re able to implement changes and get them out to their users. One complaint about a recent change: If you have a meter that syncs entries directly with the app, you no longer have the ability to adjust the time of the entry. I liked to do this for times when I end up waiting 15-45 mins after testing to take my pre-meal shot, since getting precise timing of insulin injections is more important than precise timing of BG readings while fasting. Sadly, this is no longer an option and instead the only option is to delete the synced entry and recreate it manually, which is MUCH more painful. I wish they would restore users’ the ability to manage their own data how they see fit. more Hi! Wow, thank you so much for the great review. We are so glad you found us and that you have stayed happy with our products and service. Keep up the great work and we've got your back! more"

        "review": "I love the rewards. They seem silly for an adult, but I get so bored and these keep it more stimulating. Plus, you get rewarded for healthy habits even if you haven’t lost weight. Entering products/calories is also easy, so I’m more likely to keep up with it. Before I restored, I had an older version of the app that offered the slim down avatar and the weight chart for free - those were both super motivating as well! I’m debating upgrading to pro just so I can get those features back. The quotes and panic button were also super helpful to me in the beginning when I was struggling to break habits and cravings. LOVE it! It’s the only app that works for me because it doesn’t get boring. If anything, more options for clothes (or replacing some of the clothes with more trendy versions) would be my main request. I plateaued and regained weight after a super successful year (now I’m successfully restarting)... part of it was the plateau, but I also think part of it was because I’d chosen all of the clothes/accessories I liked and wanted, so I became disengaged. Awesome for short term/teaching goals, but I would LOVE features to make it an app I can use for years, and something to keep me more engaged after I reach my goals would’ve been awesome to keep me from regaining the 40 lbs I lost using the app. more"

This app helped me lose 30 pounds without having to deprive myself of any specific food group. I entered my present weight, my goal and it calculated the healthy amount of weight for me to lose each week. All I had to do was log in what I had each meal. It gives you an option to take a picture of your meal, in case you don’t have time to log it right away. It has a huge database of foods already stored, so it’s easy to pull that information. It also gives you the macros for each meal or item. For me, it was a huge wake up call. I was completely off in my portions and the app told me the truth about the calories I was consuming. The best is that I can have a piece of cake if I monitor closely what I have the rest of the day. If you’re serious about losing weight and keeping it off (which is the hardest part), this app will be invaluable. Make it a part of your daily routine and in time you’ll do it with your eyes closed. Don’t go for fad diets that deprive you of a whole food group. It’s unsustainable, unhealthy, and ineffective. I give this app five stars. As a bonus, my kids love playing dress up with the doll.

I would highly recommend getting the pro version in order to take advantage of all the features. This app also includes a game-like leveling system in which you earn points for sticking with it. I like this system a lot, but there is one thing I would change about it: the fashion items. As you earn points, the game gives you clothing items to put on your avatar, but these clothing items are generated randomly and most of them don't fit the avatar well at all. I'm trying to lose weight - I don't want to plaster my ideal self with ill fitting clothes that make her look bigger than she is! I wish that the fashion items actually fit the avatar, and I wish that I could see a list of items to buy and save up my points to get the things I really want. Sometimes that would be all the motivation I would need to do a few extra squats or drink a little bit more water. Other than that, this app is a wonderful tool that has already helped me lose weight and be more mindful of myself. more"

Before seeking a referral to a dermatologist we tried First Derm. The app confirmed that it was in fact a fungal infection that needed a topical ointment. We started treatment a few days ago and it’s already starting to clear up. Thanks for saving us the time, money, and pain of letting this linger!! Thanks DS10484. Glad that we could help and you are seeing progress. We are very good at giving peace of mind.CheersMichael"

It no longer tracks physical activity which is one of my rehab goals, provides perc tube maintenance reminders, or medication reminders. Restarted, reinstalled, logged in and out; the usual fixes, but it’s broken. iOS on my phone is up to date. When it was working, it disappointed because previous days’ activity could not be reviewed, changes in medication reminders would not take effect until the next day, and the whole interface was clunky. Basically it’s free, but you get what you pay for: a simplistic, inflexible, feature-limited app that randomly stops working (what little it did do). It only gets 2 stars because it does provide, in-app, a direct means to connect with my treatment team. Like a hundred other communication apps, but it was integrated and direct. more Hi!

I went through the regular cardiac tests..... stress test, blood work, EKG, echo, and 48 hour mobile heart monitoring. The palpitations and rapid heart rate did not surface during these test. How discouraging, because my symptoms were real but not solid proof. My cardiologist was concerned but not convinced there could be a problem. I mean after all doctors work with concrete facts. I remembered I had a Kardia, AliveCor Mobile EKG which I had purchased a year or so before these symptoms to help with my mother's heart tracking. I started monitoring my palpitations with the view to sharing the results with my doc. I also used the device when I started to have longer rapid heart rate episodes which were sporadic and usually occurred when the Doc's office was closed. (Who can run to the doctor at a moments notice and get in? Not me) Bingo! Proof that my symptoms were real. I printed out the EKG records I had taken with my Kardia, faxed them to my cardiologist, and received a call the same day with the diagnosis of Afib. I truly believe a correct diagnosis came about faster, without a possible emergency room visit, and in the comfort/safely at home only because of this fabulous device and easy to use app. For under a hundred dollars it's the BEST investment in my and my family's health I have made. more"

        "review": "I have had atrial fibrillation for a number of years. During that time if I felt anything “off” I went to the ER. After relaxing and working with meditation all the symptoms went away every time. The doctors seemed to be as surprised as I was. There were many false alarms. At the hospital I was routinely checked-out. With 20 minutes of meditation all the systems were normal. My cardiologist was pleased with how I was being proactive. He showed me the Kardia app and I purchased it that day. The app gave me such peace of mind. I could use it to determine if I was having a heart event and needed to relax and check again to determine if I needed to go to the ER. Now, which is two years later, I have done routine daily readings and I’ve had no sign of a-fib except two times. I sent the results for an immediate reading and feedback. 20 minutes later—but using meditation and quietly coping whatever was going wrong had already resolved any concerns before my results even had been reported back to me. I keep my yearly check-ups and I’m doing great. Given my experience I recommend the Kardia app. It’s a great tool in your fight with heart disease. It’s peace of mind and no false alarm trips to the ER. It’s a huge piece of what I do to stay well and deal with my heart irregularities in a very wise way. Best of luck to anyone reading this post. more"

Treatment of A-fib is vital in preventing strokes, death, and disability. I was able to determine my skipped beats were not PVC’s from coffee consumption but PJC’s and probable culprit taking more levothyroxine than my thyroid levels warrant (plus my old pal, caffeine). Got my thyroid levels checked and Bingo! The intrinsic interpretation function will not give you that kind of diagnosis (only gives normal or not, a-fib or not options) unless you pay for an expert interpretation ($19) or get Premium package. If you can read ECG’s already, then this can help identify PSVT vs rapid A-fib, and many other dysrhythmias. No substitute for going to your provider, but the ability to share your rhythm strip is REALLY INVALUABLE. Option to carry it on your phone is brilliant because folks always have phones on their person to capture evrnts. I have added it to my first aid kit. Home health agencies should be using these and anyone doing wellness checks on older adults. I wonder how many lives this tool has saved, and how many strokes it has prevented? Amazing!

I’m currently working with a psychologist and a psychiatrist and the quality of care is just as good as being in an office except I don’t have to wear pants lol the best part is they are ON TIME. I’ve never had to wait beyond our appointment time to start a session. I did have a connectivity issue once but the customer service team had great service and refunded my copay and didn’t charge my insurance for the visit. I like that I can read a bio about my doctors before I choose to work with them. Some are available the same day and others don’t have appointments available for a few weeks, but I find scheduling options open up a lot more after your initial visit, at least for therapy. Haven’t needed to use it for a medical visit yet but I would totally use this app if I needed an antibiotic or something like that vs having to go into my normal primary care office and waiting an hour or more. The only downfall to this app is that you cannot get in touch with doctors between appointments. I can imagine why that is, but it would be so awesome if it had a messaging or voicemail service, even if they charged per message or had limitations on how often/what you could use it for. more"

If it had not been for Dr on Demand I would have had to find an urgent care center somewhere, wait hours in a room filled with other sick people and would’ve paid far more just to be told what I already intuitively know...that I have a head cold and an ear infection. These factors are what usually kept me from going to urgent care and getting the treatment I probably needed. Can you imagine being in a foreign country, not speaking the language, having to weather snow and ice on foot while you try to make your way to a hospital in a country where you don’t have insurance coverage, alone, only to have to trek back to your hotel and find the nearest pharmacy on the way? It’s a big deterrent. Now, with Dr on Demand, I can do it from the comfort of my hotel room and the app will locate the closest pharmacy. Today, this app and the wonderful doctor kept me from flying with a middle ear infection and risking potentially blowing an ear drum, which would have resulted in permanent hearing loss. I waited less than two minutes and the appointment probably only took five minutes. This is my new, most favorite health app! Everyone should download it and have it ready for when they need it. more"

You can be seen in under 5 minutes depending on the doctor and what time you need help. You can also see lots of different types of doctors. With that being said, my only cons to this app would be that if you want mental health from a psychiatrist, YOU CANNOT GET CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES FROM THESE DOCTORS!! So if you are on anti anxieties or something for ADHD, for example, they won’t be able to write you an RX. However, any other medication they can and will prescribe. My other only con would be the site/app itself, charging you for your appointment up front. Then if your insurance covers telehealth visits, you either have to wait to be reimbursed or figure out how to you’re getting your money back….it’s just a hassle to have to pay up front every time and then wait a month or longer to see what your insurance is going to do….Otherwise, this is way better than sitting in an office waiting area for however long, or having to take off work during normal 9-5ish hours, since a lot of these tele docs have later hours! This is NOT an ER, or anywhere for emergency care!!! Please don’t think it is!!! If you need stitches, you will need to see someone in person, and ASAP before you bleed out!!! Lol more"

        "review": "This app is one of the strangest things I’ve ever experienced. Strange, because I don’t understand how it exists. It doesn’t make sense. I was almost sure it wouldn’t really work, or that it would be terrible doctors. I mean it’s an app. How am I going to get real and personal medical care downloaded from the Apple store. But...it’s...real somehow. I really waited just a few minutes (instead of days or weeks for my pcp) and a doctor pops on my screen. (To be fair, I haven’t asked for their license #s and checked it up yet- but hoping that since its connected to a large insurance company, they wouldn’t risk the huge lawsuits of hiring fake doctors). So far they seem competent and have been on the mark with the diagnoses. But here’s the strangest part. I kept waiting for the bills to come in the mail. They never did. So I checked my invoices in the app and it said $0.00 What??? How is this free? Is it just a benefit for paying my insurance premiums? Sheesh. so worth it. So long as I can afford it, I’m sticking with this insurance now. (Unless I’m mistaken about how this all works) Its worth the monthly premium $ to not have days of anxiety or worry while waiting for a doc appointment. I was also able to call in at 10pm about a UTI and the prescription was sent over to my pharmacy in minutes. UTIs get worse by the hour and can be dangerous. This saved me from having to sit in a covid filled emergency room all night to solve that prob. So so so grateful! more"

        "review": "I feel Teladoc as a whole is great in theory reaching people for a multitude of health related issues. Unfortunately I had two unreliable physicians more than once and it can be difficult to switch once you have seen a specific doctor several times. No one wants to go through medical history again, and again. My physician forgot every time they filled my prescription that I could not have 3 months filled at once, this lead to me needing to request a refill from them every month! Finally the physician completely ignored my pharmacy requests leading me to make an appointment where they rescheduled me over 5 times, just to ultimately cancel with no follow dates (this is not the first time). Then the dermatology physician completely ignored everything I said and I had no resolution, waste of money! I’ve gone with out medicine for 3 weeks, I only needed a quick consult. I’d appreciate better and less struggling, maybe this means Teladoc is more transparent with their physicians resulting in better scheduling and communication to clients. It is very difficult to go on and off mental health medication. I’m willing to give Teladoc one last shot, after all maybe I’m unlucky with two unreliable physicians, but it is the last chance for me. If the results do not improve I will use other sources here on out. more Hi there, We are so sorry that you had this experience and would like to help.

        "review": "The app is beautifully designed and has fairly intuitive UI/UX, but there are just so many bugs. Tried to join the waiting room for my appointment this morning, only for the next screen to pop up for a split second, disappear, and a half cut-off yellow error message at the top of the screen to pop up. I did this probably 10-15 times trying to enter the room. I had two appointments booked in advance, and the second screen with my next appointment details had the date and add to calendar button completely overlapping on the same line. The app makes me go through the same intro screens every time I log in. Seemingly not a big deal, but super annoying to click through prompts about sharing health data, location, remembering password, etc. every single time. This info should be saved and not addressed every time. Similarly, having to fill out the mental health questionnaire each time you want to schedule an appointment with your provider is so frustrating. Maybe shorten it after the initial visit, just to check up on things that change often? It takes forever and is unnecessary to address before each (sometimes weekly) meeting. The animations between screens are nice, but move slow and get old when trying to move quickly. It tends to drag, and gives the app a slow and lagging feel. This is a small detail but it drives me nuts lol The services are great, but the app tends to hinder the experience. more Thank you for taking the time to let us know about App performance issues. If you have any more information to help our dev team make improvements, please send us an email at information@teladochealth.com with your name, phone number, and screenshot of this review along with more details.

I’ve been using this app for years and Clue has continued to update their app to improve function and usefulness for the masses. It not only tracks your period, but just about anything else health-related, too! It follows your moods, cravings, energy levels, exercise levels, weight, acne, you name it. If you mess up with following your period, you can even go to your analysis section and choose to omit a specific cycle from your overall period tracking; for example, I forgot to track my periods for a few months. When I came back, I simply hid that cycle from in history so it wouldn’t skew my future period predictions. Even from an educational standpoint, the app offers plentiful resources to gain access to information about contraception, love and sexuality, fertility, and even postpartum symptoms. You can use this app to do, literally, WHATEVER you need—it all depends on how much information you pour into it. The more data you enter, the more accurate and helpful the app will be for you. It also helps you be more attentive to what you’re feeling and how every internal and external factor is influencing all the different aspects of your personal health. I love how expansive and all-encompassing Clue is, and it has become a staple in my own health/self care journey. Thank you, Clue! more Hi, we really appreciate you taking the time to write such a positive and thoughtful review. Thank you for sharing what you find useful, it's really helpful to hear what does work for users of the app. I have shared this with the rest of the team, it will make their day!

I added in my past periods from another app and that helped a lot with it being able to always be spot on for my days. One thing I would recommend, is having a “Notes” section for days. I feel like that would be nice because I can remember why I didn’t take my BC (birth control) at a certain time and I can work on being more on time with it. It’d also be nice to keep track of other things in there, such as “my cramps were this bad today because xyz.” And instead of using just the cramps button, I can make a note of how bad or mild they were on which days so I can expect it for next time. I also feel as if it would be easier when talking to an OB/GYN about my periods because my cramps can sometimes be too horrible to the point I can’t even get up and out of bed (the top reason why I’m even taking it - and how irregular my cycle was before). A couple months ago I got the subscription to Clue, and it’s even better than I imagined! I enjoy getting the articles for what I feel on my period; certain emotions, why my cramps can be killer, etc. I’d definitely recommend this app to all my fellow friends. 💕 more"

        "review": "I like this app. I just started using it maybe 7 months ago, and even though I only had three pretty irregular periods, I was pleasantly surprised at how accurate the ovulation and period predictions were. It only took the first cycle for the next predictions to be shockingly accurate. It was very nice to have a discrete little banner warning me that my period was supposed to start soon. I love all the symptoms we can track, and the cycle analysis over time. Overall I would like to say I love the app. But I can't. Because I'm now pregnant, and there's no way for me to change my life stage to \"pregnancy\" from \"menstruating\" without signing up for Clue Plus. I understand and accept that Clue wants us to pay for the pregnancy information, but I don't understand why I can't even change my status (and effectively put my cycle on \"pause\") until I give birth. I feel disappointed that this excessively long \"cycle\" could skew the information they collected from the previous ones, making my predictions less accurate for a long time postpartum. I can't imagine how much more disappointing this would be if I had been using this app for longer. I also think it would help to add a \"postpartum\" or \"breastfeeding\" life stage, since you aren't pregnant anymore but those situations still effect if/when you menstruate. more Hello, thanks for leaving us this review. Our pregnancy tracking mode is a paid feature, but we do offer a 7-day free trial where you can test it out and see if you find the content and tracking useful (it comes with tons of guided content, painstakingly written and fact-checked by our science team, as well as a whole suite of pregnancy-specific tracking features). We also have a post-partum life stage you can choose. If you prefer not to join Clue Plus, you can also exclude a cycle in the analysis tab so your data isn’t skewed. Hope this helps!

        "review": "I will start by saying that I have been with my therapist and talkspace for years now but there are a number of issues: the biggest one being, insurance being out of network but there’s no notification of that. I just recently discovered that my insurance is OON and I had no idea until Talkspace requested payments and i checked my insurance portal. This is a HUGE deal when it comes to treatment. I, myself work in healthcare as a utilization reviewer that works to get prior authorizations so I know the urgency of ensuring not only are patients covered but that it’s communicated when they are not. When you’re doing messaging sessions weekly which are being billed for and you don’t know that they’re not covered then that only increases the need for therapy…. An alert notification in app would help to notify patients when their benefit information has changed or a phone call. Next, the glitches are pretty annoying. Having to restart the app essentially when it freezes and now with upgrading to a new phone it does not want to open with my FaceId then it just keeps trying to open itself and I have to swipe out of it, move my face away, and enter my passcode instead. I’ll have to see if I can turn off the FaceID to just use my passcode. I love my therapist and don’t intend to leave her but this insurance issue is a big issue for me. more Hi there, I am happy to hear that you love your provider and have been with Talkspace for years. I do apologize for any misunderstanding regarding your insurance and billing. I appreciate you taking the time to provide such valuable feedback as we continue to improve our user experience. more"

        "review": "I was initially matched with a therapist that specialized in a subject that I had no issues with nor did I specify I had issues with. I had to accept in order to try to change therapists, only one of which was female (which is what I wanted) so I had to accept that.. but I felt like I wished I had more choices to pick from. My therapist was nice. Very generic though, and didn’t know how to use the platform. Promised to email me something and never did. Red flags raised when she cancelled our second appointment together but we rescheduled in the same week. I really wanted routine and continuity… and I didn’t want to switch providers at this point after already going through a really tough first appointment. So I stuck with the same provider. Fast forward, she cancelled our 4th appointment, rescheduled it for two days later, then I waited on video and she never showed up and didn’t message til the next day with a pretty tepid sorry. I called (to no avail) and emailed Talkspace to share this and show my disappointment and yes I got a refund, but no apology for being treated as unimportant or uncared for. Talkspace was my therapist’s side gig so clearly not as important as her full time job which is fine if that’s ok with you. But it took its toll on me. Will not continue. To add insult to injury, the app is not very user friendly. more Hi there, thank you for taking the time to write this review. We are so sorry to hear that you had a frustrating experience with your therapist and the platform. Your feedback is immensely valuable as we continue to grow and learn as a company. What you described is something we take very seriously - we would love to see what we can do to help. Please send us an email at Feedback@Talkspace.com. We look forward to helping you. more"

        "review": "Give me all of my money back. I don’t write app reviews, but there is no way to get any type of response from customer service. I was a brand new paying subscriber that needed assistance with a billing/technical issue. I’ve reached out via email multiple times for a week with no response, which is valuable time and money going down the drain as I wait on customer service to respond to what should be a simple request. After many automated emails, I went to social media dms to try to get ahold of someone. My question could easily have been taken care of with a quick phone call but they don’t offer any type of customer service phone call. This has created much more stress and frustration on me, all while my paid subscription dwindles down. I was now charged for TWO different subscriptions that Im not using. You’ve been unable to assist me in a simple request so PAY ME BACK….all of it. This “partial refund” automated refund wizard thing isn’t the right approach. I never used your services, only spent time trying to figure out how to get set up correctly! Take This Advice CS- If you don’t have enough customer service support to handle new clients, pause taking in new subscribers until you can fully serve them. Week long delays and keeping my money is not right. I’m done trying to make Talkspace work for me on my own. Bottom line - I’ve cancelled my account(s) and I expect Full Refunds now. more Hi there, thank you for taking the time to write this review.

        "review": "This is my third time using the MDLIVE for my therapy session. At first I found the technical aspect of learning how to navigate the website very challenging. I had difficulty understanding how the whole thing worked there were no instructions on how to get to the therapist and how to handle technical issues on my IPhone. I found that I needed to remember to refresh my screen every five minutes or the picture would freeze. Or to turn off my notifications or the picture would freeze up or go black. Then you would have to hit the exit app button on the phone. Also, turn off your smart watch or the audio will go to it. Actually it’s better to just turn off your Bluetooth altogether for a video chat. I love the two therapists that I have. They’re very professional and were quick to make me feel comfortable. They asked smart questions and were attentive when I answered them. They gave me exercises that were easy to do and challenging. I think that 45min is not enough time for the first two sessions. I had so much trauma in the past that once I got started it was hard to stop talking in the 45 minutes allowed. I think a wider assortment of specialists is needed. This should be expanded once the kinks are worked out. I love the fact that I’m safe at home when I’m talking about my trauma and that I don’t have to drive home with tears running down my face trying to drive while trying to get myself together. That’s the best part. more We appreciate you taking the time to post your feedback! It pleases us to know you had a great experience and we look forward to serving you again in the future! more"

        "review": "First, a 10 minute wait to see a doctor is unheard of today. It was eight minutes. Second, this doctor actually read my chart and the notes before he came online. That was another first in my experience. Third, he asked the best questions. He asked questions directly related to what was happening to me and what had happened in my recent history that was associated to this call. Fourth, I have a condition that is worsening. He actually broached that fact and the fact that I really need to see a specialist and what the consequences for me are short term and long term. My own PC will not talk to me about my condition. Fifth, he offered an alternative medication that has not been tried and I’m excited about using this med as a short-term treatment until I can see a specialist. Sixth, when he wished me well and hoped that I would feel better soon, it was authentic. He actually hopes that I will get relief and get back on my feet shortly. That was absolutely unique. I don’t know if every doctor in the service is as good as Dr. Lynn, but if they come close, they are better than the majority of doctors out there these days in my experience. more Thank you so much for your review!

        "review": "I tried to get an appointment at 8PM last night but didn’t understand the process and finally scored an appointment at 9:56PM last night. They said it would be a 3 hour wait. I got a call every 30 minutes asking if I wanted to cancel my appointment- until about midnight. I thought they would call but finally fell asleep. I woke up about 6AM and checked the app for my wait time. It said 15 minute wait. After 20 minutes I checked again to see my wait time. It became a 30 minute wait time ... so I called customer and got through. (Something I had not been able to do since making an appointment) and there was a nice man named James who apologized profusely about 9 hour wait. He then recommended I schedule a time appointment (why couldn’t I do that in the first place) for 12:30 - which would be quicker than a next available. Oh my word! So I decided to do it anyway since I was still having symptoms even though I was feeling better. I got a call back 10 minutes later saying there was a mistake and the doctor couldn’t do it over a text gone call. Had to be video chat so now they were rescheduling until 4:30PM - you know, right about the time pharmacies are closing because of Corona. I decided to take it anyway. Finally feel better and just canceled. I completely understand that there are back ups due to Corona but my wait time was completely ridiculous and they did not handle this in a professional way. They are not reputable in my opinion. more Please accept our apology for your frustration. Requests for virtual health care have increased significantly due to the spread of COVID-19. As a result, wait times to see an MDLIVE doctor may exceed our usual 15 minutes in some parts of the country. Our doctors are working hard to address all patients as quickly as possible while maintaining our high standard of care.

She was kind and warm in our interaction and it really was just like a doctors visit in an office but I never had to get out of bed. I’m feeling terrible and the thought of having to get up, dressed drive and commit probably 2 or more hours out Was too daunting. She spent all the time needed with no rush. I called because I felt like I had a uti, which came on very quick. I’ve experienced this multiple times a year the last few years and I was discouraged to have to go through all the motions of physically seeing a doctor when I suspected I needed antibiotics, it’s been a 5 minute discussion in the past, prescription and done. So, she diagnosed me just the same as physically having to see a doctor. She gave me the precautions to look for if I were to get worse and needed a face to face visit. She called in my prescription, so, I can just make a quick trip to pick it up and I’ll be better. My insurance no longer covers my doctor I’ve seen for years and I don’t want to switch so, when I rarely need a doctor, I pay out of pocket anyway. So, it was only about $15 more than an in office visit. This service is amazing and I’m so glad I decided to try it. I’m so thankful for seeing dr. Savery today. more"

I was worried about having multiple doctors but the Doctors are awesome, compassionate, ask the right questions, in a short period of time, and never rushed. PlushCare keeps a log of your visits. Which is headache free to remember them all. I get frequent utis. Having to sit for hrs in an emergency room in pain. I no longer have to wait. Make an appt, be prepared to answer questions. Docs are earlier than appt and so far the Docs are better than an emergency visit. When you know you need antibiotics. The docs do send you to get a culture tests done. Pick a location close to you. So easy to get done, quickly. Lab techs are just as fantastic! I have had my culture lab test lost at an emergency room twice and your sitting not knowing for more hrs. They lost it. (Mind you. Your paying for it.)😞 I felt nervous seeing multiple Doctors but so far. 💯 stress free. Most of all affordable and do use your ins, too. If you have it. PlushCare is a Godsend. This is just a perfect way to see a doctor for minor medical issues without leaving your home. Easy to set up. Easy to change your pu location for meds, etc... So easy to use, bottom line. Thank you Dr Crabtree and Dr Riad 😊 Also I will mention the communication thru, video chat, emails and texts, is easy and not confusing at all. 👍👍👍 more"

Although I was fully vaccinated I developed a fever and a cold that progressed into the worst sore throat I have ever experienced in my life. I started getting really nervous as my throat was severely inflamed and I believe I developed throat ulcers. I had terrible coughing fits that burned terribly and I was concerned about my breathing going forward as I was struggling with swallowing. The constant nasal drip made things more difficult. This went on for two full days. Finally I was able to book a 7am appt with Dr Chansky after being up at 2pm, again. She knew right away what I was experiencing and prescribed Miracle Mouthwash and an anti inflammatory that my partner picked up just three hours later. Later, after approximately 25 hours of excruciating pain, my throat like opened up and almost all of my throat pain dissipated-I could swallow normally again! The Magic Mouthwash helped me sleep and eat in the interim. Ps-I eventually discovered that green tea w coconut oil and greasy lo mein noodles was a saving grace to put down food and medicine and stay hydrated. Thank you Dr. Chansky and thank you Plushcare!!! You saved me and kept me out of the very swamped hospital. more"

        "review": "As someone who has suffered from migraines for my entire life I was always trying to find an effective way to track them and record details. However, I kept having trouble remembering and keeping everything organized. I love this app because it’s so easy to enter the info, but it also has a good amount of detail. It compiles the data and presents it to you in an interesting way that can help you get a new perspective on symptoms, triggers, and your body’s patterns. I especially like the sleep tracking part (it’s linked to my FitBit, but it can also link to an Apple Watch), as that is one of my main triggers, and having definitive information about my sleep schedule can really help me predict and prevent migraines. The resources are helpful and the chat forum is a wonderful place to discuss your experiences with other migraine sufferers, as well as to get advice or tips on how to manage your migraines. My main issues with the app are mostly that there are occasionally typos, which can sometimes make it feel slightly less professional, and that the layout could probably be improved a little (it’s quite bland and sometimes things kinda blur together). If I were to suggest anything I would suggest the ability to make a more in-depth profile and the option to do private messaging. I believe it would be quite helpful to be able to have one-on-one conversations with people you might have met through the forum. more Thank you for your strong support! You can send your buddy link to other users and start a one to one chat with them. Just post in a group chat your buddy link adding @user name you want to have a private conversation with.

        "review": "As someone who’s struggled with chronic debilitating migraines for over 15 years and tried so so many different things without any success... I’d also tried many different tracking methods and finally decided that tracking wasn’t going to help, but hinder, as it caused too much focus on the migraines and I needed to focus on living. But this app has changed all of that!!! THANK YOU Migraine Buddy for creating something that helps me do both! For helping me easily, quickly and simply input data about my migraines, keep track, and keep living my life to the best of my ability. But ALSO, the oh so helpful tools, connection with the community, reports, weather (my biggest trigger has always been barometric pressure!! - and now for the first time EVER I have the ability to plan to the hour of when I can take my meds or know when I’m going to start going downhill just to know even if I can’t take one of my meds... it’s helps to know if I need to buck up or to go lay down if I can), ability to see patterns, etc... this app and its tools has been the single most helpful thing in the last decade for me of communicating with my doctors, identifying my auras, and figuring out what actually helps. Thank you!! All in a way that doesn’t take over my life and keep me fixated on my migraines - they are already present enough! If you have migraines and are thinking about this app - GET IT! more Thank you so much for such a great review! Jenny more"

        "review": "I’ve had migraines the majority of my life but they increased in severity and frequency in the last five years to the point I went searching for more answers and treatments than OTCs could offer. A doctor told me I should be tracking them to better understand my triggers and my research led me to this app. I love the interface. It’s calming to look at when I do have a migraine. It feels like a friend who understands my pain, my triggers, and what helps. Being able to track them and see patterns is very useful. I do subscribe to the plus version but it’s totally worth it to me even though I feel it’s a bit pricey. I’ve been subscribed long enough I’ve seen them add updates and use user feedback to improve what the app offers so I feel like the developers listen and respond to us. I like the discussions with other users. I love that I’m helping contribute to research for migraines. The guides to understanding migraines were helpful because I didn’t know a lot and I learned so much through the app. The app helped me figure out what my triggers even are, and a few were surprising, and other users helped me figure out some options for relief. Great app overall. With a lot of great features even if you don’t subscribe for all of them. more Thank you so much for the compliment.

For some reason this past year I went through a few rough illnesses, one in particular that no one was able to accurately diagnose. I was in the worst pain I have ever been in and everyone kept telling me that it was nothing, or that they weren’t sure what was causing it. With nowhere left to turn I decided to downloaded this app put my symptoms in to try and find out something about what might be going on. The app makes it clear that this is not a true medical diagnosis and that you should always seek help from a doctor in person when you can, but even still it came up with a few possible diagnoses that I was curious about. Nearly a week later, when my condition finally got bad enough a doctor was able to figure out what was causing the pain and it turned out to be the same diagnosis this app suggested as the most likely cause of my symptoms. Since this incident I have used the app a few more times and it has been very helpful and incredibly informative. more"

        "review": "I’m diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ada has been able to help me distinguish between when I’m having an anxiety attack or when my muscle aches and pains were more than just side effects of my meds. However, I believe that ada could be improved if we were able to add pre existing conditions to our profiles, in addition to our prescriptions actually factoring into the reports. Am I feeling fatigued because of my meds? Or is it something else? Pre existing conditions and medications can make it that much harder to question if it’s more than a side effect. And especially in the times of Covid seeking medical help is just getting more expensive in the US. But ada has helped me see when I should and shouldn’t go to the doctor (they helped me recognize the symptoms of pneumonia in time for me to get diagnosed before my lungs would be damaged any further than they were). I love this program, I just wish we could add the illnesses we already have and the effects our meds have on us. Of course the devs can’t list every medication, but letting us list the symptoms those meds cause should be factored into ada’s reports. There’s more conditions other than smoking, diabetes, etc that ada currently lists, and I feel the preexisting conditions are very limited. And I hope my thoughts on this are seen by the devs and can be brought into consideration. more"

It lists a number of different things you could have, some of them are less likely then others. You can read about the sickness and it even gives you remedies to treat it. This app has helped me a number of times, and it’s also very easy and simple to use. You can get a symptom assessment done in only a few minutes because the questions are simple and straight to the point. Still, you should always see a doctor if you’re worried, and I’m happy to say ada does also remind you that. I have nothing bad to say about this app at all.

I literally held my fingers on my keypad just waiting on the link, but I guess I was slow at responding within 15 seconds, and again it was canceled shame on me, but I should have went to another virtual clinic at that time but when we’re sick, we do weird things so I book with them again needless to say finally at 9 o’clock on the day that I booked the same appointment with a clinic it took me all of 20 minutes to fill out everything I needed to fill out and be seen by my doctor and get diagnosed and get my prescriptions!!

Once I did complete setup and attempted to connect with a provider online, I was told the provider I selected would contact me promptly. 15 minutes later there was no call and no record of the pending appointment anywhere on my account. There was no way to contact anyone or receive any kind of update. I attempted to set up another appointment in fear that I hadn’t properly set the original appointed - went through the entire process only to be told that my initial appointment was still pending, and I could not set up another appointment until the initial appointment completed. Another 15 minutes go by, and I finally get a call from a physician that was not the physician I selected. He then proceeded to tell me that he wasn’t authorized to prescribe antiviral treatments for Covid 19 because I was not high risk, even though that is not in alignment with the CDC’s most recent messaging. All in all, I spent hours and $80 to get told inaccurate information from a physician that was not the one I selected. While the $80 is the max you will pay, the app was unable to confirm my insurance carrier, so made me pay the full amount in full before I could see a physician. All in all - very poor experience and I will not use this app again. more Thank you for taking the time to let us know. This is important feedback and I will share this with the team. more"

        "review": "After working in my yard (weeding with gloves), noticed a row of itchy- but tender- bumps along my wrist, some very tiny and one “main” one; they became red with a sort of salmon cast after a few days and didn’t resolve. At first, was reminded of a spider bite I got as a kid, with several satellite small bumps. They aren’t intensely itch but are pretty tender if I try to scratch. After about 4 days, i stopped wearing my watch to see if that affected it (nope). After a week or so, I applied topical steroid cream once, yesterday. These seems to be a little blistery looking. No new ones appeared. SO DECIDED TO CHECK THIS APP- it came up with several options, the top 3 of which are my top 3 diagnoses: insect bite/ atopic dermatitis/poison ivy. I’m sticking to insect bite since there is tenderness >> itching and no new lesions or spread since the first 24 hours. Putting watch on R wrist hasnt led to new irritation. I like the app for reassuring me that I wasn't likely missing anything! It Might be helpful to collect a little more history such as contact with allergen or outdoor or gardening exposure vs no outdoor exposure. more"

I mean a lot of work went into it but like someone else said, it just gives you an encyclopedic list of ideas of what rash, bite, bruise, etc might be. And there are NO realistic pics to compare yours with. I mean, I had a mosquito bite which I uploaded just to see how good the app was and it gave me back a pic of a crusted purple sore and asked me if mine was like it. The pics they show you in all the suggested options they compare yours to look nothing like your own pic you’ve uploaded. You are better off googling what you think yours is and then clicking on ‘Google image’ - you’ll get a hundred images and easily find one that looks like yours which you can then click on and read about. more"

        "review": "I’ve been using Bearable for about a month (after trying out some other trackers). I felt compelled to leave a review as I typically fall off the wagon with these kinds of things, but I’m consistently using this app after a month. I I can’t speak to what Bearable does or doesn’t do in comparison with others, because I never made it past the initial steps with the other apps and got frustrated with too many options and the general inflexibility (made me feel like I had to figure out exactly what I wanted to track right then and there when life just isn’t like that). Bearable has a ton of ways to customize that can seem overwhelming, but you can also initially hide those categories and track the most important stuff first and add in other factors and symptoms as time goes on. I really like that it integrates with apple health and I really love that the developer is very open to feedback and sharing about features that are in the works. Integration with Fitbit would be great, but for now syncing my Fitbit info to apple health with FitSync is working absolutely fine. Bearable automatically grabs the info. The trial period was SO helpful. Other apps have trial periods as well, but I cancelled them only days in after I’d had enough. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop but it’s yet to happen with this. Highly recommended. more"

        "review": "To start off with, this is the first app review that I have ever written - and I stopped using Bearable consistently probably a year ago, but occasionally it weighs on my heart to let others know my success story with Bearable. I had struggled with severe major depression, generalized anxiety, PTSD, and OCD (and still do, to a lesser extent) for close to a decade. I decided to invest in Bearable because anxiety had begun leaving me completely unable to function every single day — like literally spent a week in bed just incessantly panicking. Cue setting up Bearable, painstakingly inputting every detail I could think of. I found after several months of use that many of the things that I thought were “right” were actually leaving me in absolute wreckage, while my partner and his family were consistently bring my mood up SUBSTANTIALLY. Seeing the numbers laid out encouraged me to make the difficult decision of leaving what I now identify was a cult. It helped me cut ties with abusive situations that had trapped my family for generations. It helped me learn what joy was after years of hospital visits, SH episodes, panic attacks, and starvation. I am now living my best life and will look to Bearable again occasionally for answers to menial health concerns. This app changed my life and I would almost definitely not be here without it. more"

I also have chronic migraines from a severe head injury. Because of my autism, it's been difficult to communicate how I'm doing to my therapists and psychiatrists and doctors, and often I was not believed about the severity of my symptoms, or accused of not taking my medication, or told that my sleep or energy is better than I think it is. Now I have EMPIRICAL DATA all gathered in one place that provides an accurate assessment of my moods, symptoms both mental and physical, everything all in one place. My only complaint is that I wish you could time stamp EVERYTHING, not just medication times and mood and energy but also factors and symptoms instead of being limited to 4 time ranges because I'd like to see if a short-term intervention works and right now I can only see that I listen to relaxing music when I get anxious, but not whether I feel less anxious after listening to relaxing music.

It also explains the best way to take them, will let you know if there’s a recall even before it goes really public, and you can set the App up to notify you to take your medication. It will also check the Rx against your allergy list. Just recently , the app notified me that a new beta blocker I was prescribed had a major interaction with one of my chemos. It took my oncologist a week to find the source of that information in a tiny little article in JAMA, and it was absolutely correct. Things could have gone very south without that information and it was not in any of the Rx literature. This App also provides vital medical information when you or anyone else needs to know what you take in an emergency. You can also print out all the information either as a full sheet or as wallet cards to keep with you.

I even have to split my vitamins up and take them at a different time because they’ll interfere with meds. And I have to take my metoprolol at a two hour later window now both morning and night because it was interfering with my one of my other meds and causing an increase in my heart rate which was the opposite affect of why I’m taking it! Since then, problem solved. I needed more potassium because of muscle cramps thanks to ehlers danslos so I ordered some but added it on here and saw the LIFE THREATENING affect they’d have on my because of heart issues I had and basically told me DONT TAKE TAKE THEM. So I cancelled them right away. Over all this app is awesome and wonderful!! No doctor or pharmacist can do what this app can because they can’t keep all this information in their head.

I didn’t see how to delete them, but rather “hide them”. Hiding them made them disappear into somewhere I wouldn’t know where to look if I wanted them shown again. 3) Metric scale doesn’t have ability to count 0 (therefore making something like counting number of drinks, with 0 being the goal, impossible. 4) Even the feedback form in the app seems faulty. Tried to use it but every time I tried to press return for a new bullet the form disappeared. Unsure if it was submitting or just closing out. 5) The graphs are a good start but I’d like to see a daily chart as well, not just weekly or monthly. For a paid app this just falls way short.

I went through the regular cardiac tests..... stress test, blood work, EKG, echo, and 48 hour mobile heart monitoring. The palpitations and rapid heart rate did not surface during these test. How discouraging, because my symptoms were real but not solid proof. My cardiologist was concerned but not convinced there could be a problem. I mean after all doctors work with concrete facts. I remembered I had a Kardia, AliveCor Mobile EKG which I had purchased a year or so before these symptoms to help with my mother's heart tracking. I started monitoring my palpitations with the view to sharing the results with my doc. I also used the device when I started to have longer rapid heart rate episodes which were sporadic and usually occurred when the Doc's office was closed. (Who can run to the doctor at a moments notice and get in? Not me) Bingo! Proof that my symptoms were real. I printed out the EKG records I had taken with my Kardia, faxed them to my cardiologist, and received a call the same day with the diagnosis of Afib.

        "review": "I have had atrial fibrillation for a number of years. During that time if I felt anything “off” I went to the ER. After relaxing and working with meditation all the symptoms went away every time. The doctors seemed to be as surprised as I was. There were many false alarms. At the hospital I was routinely checked-out. With 20 minutes of meditation all the systems were normal. My cardiologist was pleased with how I was being proactive. He showed me the Kardia app and I purchased it that day. The app gave me such peace of mind. I could use it to determine if I was having a heart event and needed to relax and check again to determine if I needed to go to the ER. Now, which is two years later, I have done routine daily readings and I’ve had no sign of a-fib except two times. I sent the results for an immediate reading and feedback. 20 minutes later—but using meditation and quietly coping whatever was going wrong had already resolved any concerns before my results even had been reported back to me. I keep my yearly check-ups and I’m doing great. Given my experience I recommend the Kardia app. It’s a great tool in your fight with heart disease. It’s peace of mind and no false alarm trips to the ER. It’s a huge piece of what I do to stay well and deal with my heart irregularities in a very wise way. Best of luck to anyone reading this post. more"

        "review": "30+ years in Critical Care nursing, and w/ a few health issues of my own now, I can only say “Wow!” This is a great tool for those wishing to know if they are having Atrial Fibrillation episodes so they can get prompt treatment. Treatment of A-fib is vital in preventing strokes, death, and disability. I was able to determine my skipped beats were not PVC’s from coffee consumption but PJC’s and probable culprit taking more levothyroxine than my thyroid levels warrant (plus my old pal, caffeine). Got my thyroid levels checked and Bingo! The intrinsic interpretation function will not give you that kind of diagnosis (only gives normal or not, a-fib or not options) unless you pay for an expert interpretation ($19) or get Premium package. If you can read ECG’s already, then this can help identify PSVT vs rapid A-fib, and many other dysrhythmias. No substitute for going to your provider, but the ability to share your rhythm strip is REALLY INVALUABLE. Option to carry it on your phone is brilliant because folks always have phones on their person to capture evrnts. I have added it to my first aid kit. Home health agencies should be using these and anyone doing wellness checks on older adults. I wonder how many lives this tool has saved, and how many strokes it has prevented? Amazing! Thank you! more"

I love this app because I don’t have to find a sitter or load up my children in the car to take them to sit in a waiting room. The funny thing is...I started using Maven as part of a paid focus group, and now I love it and will be using it often. The medical professionals are great. They really listen to you and offer practical advice. Being at home is very comfortable, and I feel safer discussing sensitive things like my sex drive or weight. Some medical professionals can even write you a prescription. The prices are great in my opinion. More often than not you pay less than a copay to get straight to the point with your medical questions. No filling out extensive paperwork. No germy waiting areas. No consulting forums with people who aren’t qualified to give you medical advice. Even sessions with specialized doctors aren’t too much more than an average copay. The app is attractive and very easy to use. Make sure you fill in your health binder, and writer a brief pre-appointment note to help your doctor, therapist, or nurse practitioner know what you need. more"

The app itself is really pleasant to use. I also appreciate the access to experts. I've been able to connect with a dietician and PT when I've had questions, as well as a care navigator who helped me understand how to use the app. The PT was really appreciated - there was a 3-4 week waitlist to get into a pelvic health therapist locally, but I was able to schedule with a MavenPT for the next day. I’ve also benefited greatly from the lactation support (thanks, Susie!!) since the baby came. We have access through my husband’s employer, and I’d encourage all employers to offer it. Not only did it improve our pregnancy experience, we saved so much time from not having to travel to/from appointments (I.e., we took less time away from our jobs), and we saved healthcare costs by not having to see specialists in person. more"

I’ve been able to get same-day video appointments and texts from exceptional practitioners. For example, I got a 7pm same-day appointment with a world class reproductive endocrinologist when I needed fertility advice after a miscarriage. When I had sharp sciatic pain, I got an appointment in less than an hour with a physical therapist who showed me exercises over video chat while I was in bed in my pajamas. When I have quick questions about what meds to take while pregnant or whether it’s ok to eat certain things, I message an OB and usually get a response in under 30 minutes. It’s so much better than going through my normal healthcare provider, where it takes weeks to get an appointment and every checkup is so transactional. Maven is quick, easy, and has great doctors. So grateful for Maven! more"

When a friend suggested this app, I thought, “Why have I never considered trying to manage them through technology?!” And I am so amazed! Just Wow! It’s changed my life so much!! I literally have to take medicine every two hours, so getting an alert instead of having to watch the clock is such a game changer for me! Also, no more guessing whether I took a medicine or not … and what time I actually took it (which is important for timing out my meds because I can’t take certain meds too close together). I can look back and say, “oh yeah, I was late taking this med by 30 minutes, so let me reschedule this next med for 30 minutes later. Oh, and that throws off the schedule for these others, so let me “easily” reschedule those as well.” Entering all my meds into the app was so easy and being able to enter the Rx number, amount of pills left, and set notifications for when to refill … guys, I just can’t say enough. It’s one of the simplest apps on my phone, but one that has had the greatest impact on my life. Thank you (to the developers) for making such a great, well thought out, powerful but simple to use app. It’s simplicity to use is what makes it so great. Making it complicated would have detracted from its power as the time-saving, life-saving tool you’ve developed. more"

I can’t open the app. I can't do anything as tapping on its icon makes it load and then after less than 3 seconds it instantly closes and the same thing happens if I reopen it. I tried to open it five times and the same thing happens. A phone restart did not fix this and I am now worried this update that the App Store says was released Sunday means I can’t keep track of meds **easily** as I have been doing for years until (if?) this weird bug gets fixed. I stuck with this app for years as it was the only way to make sure I 100% took my meds with my severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Before using it I skipped meds rather than accidentally take a double dose (I forget and obsess about taking a medicine or not a looot….) so I am hoping this gets fixed within a week. I am editing the review to note that I never created an account for this app because of privacy worries so I can’t delete it and re-download it to see if that fixes it :( ***second edit added after the August 25th update follows***: it works!

When I do I usually research the med and it’s side effects. Even in my research I don’t always come across every interaction it has with other foods or meds. Seems like more meds keep getting added to my care every other day. My doctor called me this afternoon with a new med based on some lab work. No mention to interactions with my current meds. My husband picks up the meds from the pharmacy, no mention by the pharmacist of any interactions. Load the new med into the app and check for interactions and critical alert and red is what I see. Immediately call the pharmacist and not only could I not take the med at the time I was planning, I can’t take it with 2 of my other critical meds. If it wasn’t for this app I don’t know if I would have found this interaction on my own but my doctors and pharmacist most certainly should have. With my vitals and current condition there was a high chance that I would have stopped breathing in the middle of the night. Thank you seriously!

In addition I’ve since been able too experience Ochsner and if could give more than 5*, I definitely would be. I had to have an EUS done there; every single individual I encountered regardless of involved in my care directly or indirectly, they ALL showed such kindness, respect, compassion, that I’d not had this kind of care anywhere else. And I mean everyone I crossed paths with and not just on the date of my procedure but also at a whole different location where I went to see my new Ochsner oncologist at Luling and again 5* too infinity more, because everyone right down to the receptionist and the individual working at their tiny cafe was AMAZING!

MyChart is the easiest, most efficient way to communicate with your provider and your healthcare team, to communicate with you. I always encouraged patients to use MyChart instead of relying on telephone calls. You see, if you don’t use MyChart and only communicate via a phone you will have greater wait times when you are expecting a result for a test, an answer to a question, or a prescription refill request. We are not allowed to leave any info on a voicemail so all you’ll get from a missed call is the name of the person calling and a callback number. With MyChart you will get your answer or results with the first correspondence. It’s secure and so easy to use. You get a text notification whenever anything new pops up so it’s hard to miss a result or response from the provider. If you rely on the phone remember that if the medical staff calls you and you don’t answer you go to the end of a very big line. It can take 2-3 days before you make it back to the front of the line. MyChart allows you practically instant access to your results. It’s a godsend for both the patients and medical staff.

There are a few things that the app / providers need to perfect MyChart however for it to be up in the five star range. 1. You need to enable the saving of all records regardless of type by the patient user as a PDF file. Having to take scrolling screen shots and save them so they can be opened into an image to PDF converter is a real pain. Safari already allows PDF saving of browser windows, MyChart needs to do the same. 2. Lab results, Practitioner Summaries and Notes, Radiology reports, surgery procedure notes and summaries need the ability for the patient to email them to primary and other secondary providers without having to go through the hoops in Item 1 and then emailing them. 20 Jul 2023: Received reply from Epic. I have used the Web site instead for Item 1; but, it will be more convenient from the app. Will update when that happens. The emailing is an isdue however that currently is only addressed by downloading a PDF the uploading on other providers portals rather than directly from MyChart. I find myself constantly having to do this because providers do not update secondary providers and visa versa. I feel like a mouse on an exercise wheel having go do the work that providers should be doing. more We are always looking to improve the experience for our users, and really appreciate the feedback.

        "review": "So I have to keep track of my cancer pain. It’s in my bones among other areas in my body. My pain management dr needs to understand the issues better than my brain dead answers the day I see her give. This app takes care of everything about the pain records I need to keep. It goes into great detail so that I may have the answers directly bob hand. During this pandemic, when my Drs appts are strictly done by video, this is perfect so that I can have the info right at my fingertips. It also helps when my wife needs to understand how bad it is for each day and understand when the breakthrough pain takes control and I need to seek emergency care. This is an amazing app. It should be shouted from the rooftops to help all suffering from any pain. more"

        "review": "I started sending a review because I got the map and the segments where not as shown when I purchased the app. This is an option in the upper right corner. You CAN change body maps. It will erase all data from previous but this more segmented map is what should appear in the app when you open it. It is MORE appealing with more options to choose your pain location and many people will not figure this out. You should change that quickly. So when one opens the app they see what they have indeed purchased and not something else, initially getting bummmed that it’s not what the purchased page showed and much later finding out it was there as an option. Weird business if you ask me. more"

I have a difficult time expressing the severity of my pain to my doctors. This app is a must if you have chronic pain, with or without a diagnosis. The suggestions for managing your type of pain is so helpful. I especially appreciate the reminders for tracking, I always forgot to keep my logs with other apps and then couldn’t be specific during my check ups. This allows my doctors to have insight on my conditions activity. Living in pain is difficult, but with this app you don’t have to feel alone. Thank you for this app it has changed my life. more"

        "review": "The Spruce product and engineering teams deserve some recognition—3 weeks ago, I submitted a feature request through the feedback link in the app, and within a few short weeks they had implemented it! Maybe they were already working on it, but what a coincidence! Check out the new privacy screen they added in v4.4.4. When you switch apps and Spruce is put in the background, instead of continuing to show your private conversation, now the app content is covered with a full screen app logo. You won’t see it in action until you switch back to the Spruce app, which will then fade out the privacy screen and show the normal app content. Thank you again Spruce engineering and product teams for prioritizing user privacy and for making the privacy screen behavior so natural that I think most people will just be happier and feel safer, without consciously knowing why. For me, what a treat it is to experience firsthand the generous responsiveness and skillful implementation of the engineers. Way to go!

        "review": "I recently switched my private counseling practice over to Spruce and my only regret is n not having done it sooner. I love being able to send and receive faxes in my phone. Having a secure phone “line” that uses my existing phone is wonderful. I can tag clients so I can do searches for people with similar issues and email them information that might be relevant to them. I can “page“ myself to remind me to do a client related task or follow up with them. (It’s kind of like the marking.) I can get off of the phone with a client and immediately write a note to document the call. I can do video sessions. I’m looking forward to improvements such as clients being able to access from their PC (right now they have to use a smart phone) and better reporting so that I can more easily send out the client records when requested. But they’re a great service for a great price. My anxiety level has literally gone down because of the seamlessness of this service. Thank you Spruce! more Thank you for taking the time to share your experience on Spruce — we appreciate it and are glad to hear that you are using many of Spruce’s features to their full potential in your practice.

I had taken my night time medications which included my Diovan for high blood pressure, as well as the medication Prozocin which was prescribed for PTSD and was never told by any of my physicians that this was originally prescribed for high blood pressure. I went to my doctor for a treatment and I was so lethargic that the on call doctor thought I had overdosed because my blood pressure was so low 48/20 and he told the nurse to give me Narcan which made me very very sick. They were told that I hadn’t taken anything besides my blood pressure pill and the 3 Prozocin for my PTSD. And they never mentioned that I had literally taken too much medication to combat high blood pressure between the two medications. I came home from the hospital and went to WebMD and found answers about all of my medications and I had three other medications that were not supposed to be used together and made an appointment to discuss this with my physician and my medications were changed. After this close call I always use WebMd to check out any mew prescription that I am given before I ever get it filled. Thank you WEBMD FOR SAVING MY LIFE! Rhonda Moffatt more"

I still have to close the app to get out of a major category, such as Conditions or Search. Now, in addition, if I am in Conditions, the A-Z list will not come up at all, even though it says it’s displaying. This means I can only access the Popular Searches. I’m out of luck if I need to look up something rare. I hope these will be fixed soon. Further update: Despite more updates to the app, all of the annoying bugs already mentioned are still there. I still have to close the app in order to go to another section (e.g., from Conditions to Drugs). I still can’t bring up the A-Z list of Conditions, or the A-Z list of Drugs; it’s only the Most Popular for both. No scrolling to a rare condition, or to a drug that isn’t on the top 94.

I then searched for “online chat with doctor” and found this app. I was extremely skeptical and figured I would have to pay once installed and I wasn’t prepared to do that as I didn’t know whether this was a legitimate app/service. However, it said I could chat for free immediately. I went ahead and entered my information and question and for some reason, I was lucky enough to be first in line. Dr. Mary Jensen was so helpful. She immediately told me what I could do to address this concern at home (it was the type of issue that genuinely could be dealt with at home, at least initially, and then if that doesn’t work, I suppose I will go in to visit a doctor and get prescription medicine, if required). I can’t tell you how happy and relieved I am. I had that type of anxiety which is acutely heightened at night and I am so grateful to have been able to address this concern immediately. I actually think this app is worth paying for now, (but the beauty of it is that there is also some service provided for free) and if you are parents of little ones, like I am, it could be really useful, in particular. more"

        "review": "This app was a very quick and efficient way to take care of my medical anxieties. I had a recent scare with a possible Tetanus infection. There was not a lot of answers I could find online for my specific case, so I went to look for a real chatroom, and happened on this app. The prices are a bit steep for average app fees, but definitely not as steep as going to urgent care in the USA. Additionally, it took not even 20 minutes to chat with a real doctor instead of possibly being put on hold for hours on end with other 24 hour services. With quick, efficient, and good advice, the session was over with what to look for and what to keep doing. Additionally, theres a free 3 day trial to make sure that this service is right for you. A perfect amount of time to get quick service when you need for a first time. They also have different plans for perhaps more chronic issues or, like me, getting service for a once in a while medical inquiry. Additionally, the app features other handy tools such as a way to track vaccinations as well as view past chats. I haven’t explored to many of the features deeply, but it’s nice to see a logging feature on a medical app like this. Obviously not a replacement for the ER, but a great app to turn to for more urgent and primary care type questions, especially with Covid19 making going to the doctor less of a chore and more of a gamble. more"

Now, as for the SCAM? First…You’ll notice when you speak to a “doctor” that they literally just give you a copy and paste of what your problems could be from WebMD’s website. After that, they’ll say they’ll give you a prescription for your needs. Mine happened to be $19. They asked for which pharmacy I’d like to receive my meds at, and proof (picture) of my ID. Then, they’ll send a link (this link will have no actual proof of anything just a link for standard payment) once paid, I didn’t receive any follow up about my meds. I waited 24hrs and went to cvs to get it and nothing was there. I contacted a doctor via the app again, and they said I should receive an email when it’s been sent to the pharmacy. After 3 days of back and fourth with CVS (mind you, the free trial is 3 days) it was confirmed that no prescription was sent. Nor was one on the way. They also confirmed that doctors nor hospitals can verify when you’re prescription is ready for pick up. Only the actual pharmacy can do that. In short? Save your time, headache, and overall money. I’d give zero stars if I could. more Hello. Sorry to hear your experience was not to our standard. To prevent this from happening again, we hired a team of pharmacists that get in touch with the pharmacy on your behalf to ensure the prescription has been delivered. Our team processes all prescriptions within 24 hours, and you are entitled to a full refund if our team is unable to send your prescription to your pharmacy within the given time frame. I am hoping that by now, you have received a full refund for the experience you had with us in the past but in case you haven't, kindly contact support@yourdoctors.online. We apologize for not being able to provide you with the best service, but your feedback helped us improve. We hope that you would be able to give our application another chance to see the difference your feedback has made. Thank you. more"
